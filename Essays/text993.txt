Yes, is a good idea because if high school selected to guide them towerd a specific career, because we can see how difficult be, or if be easy to go the college, however, is good idea, because you can see if you are soure of want the specific career, or you want change for other career, because some time the career you want is be difficult and you can`t do it. So we can have ideas how the college be, so if the high school put the this opcion be great, because when you finished the high school you really have a idea what you want to pick for the college or what career you want to take.

Some time was make difficult to pick the class or the career because din`t have ideas, so with this opcion is be great because we have ideas how take a college class.

When you are not soure what you want to pick for you career, this is a good opcion, because be help you to know how college is.

Is good idea, because the estudents be really have a idea how the college is, and when the estudents be have to go to the college be going with some ideas, and the estudents really know how the college or the class is, because they were had ideas from the high school.

I agreement with this opcion becuase is be helper for all the estudents, this is be helper for when we have to go the college or university, and you really know what talk about or what going on. This opcion is be great, becuase at a young age, they know somethink about the college, and when they be have to go the college or university they remind what laernd in the high school, so this be helper to all estudents becuase is be good think. When the estudent going to the college they going wiht ideas or think, so that is more easy because they have a somentink mind and that is be great.
