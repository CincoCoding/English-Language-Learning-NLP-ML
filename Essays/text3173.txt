Thomas Jefferson wrote Determine never to be idle.. it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. I agree that we accomplish more if we are always doing something right or important, however, that it doesnt mean that you are idle. While, if we are working or study.

They are many people that works on importants jobs, sometime they suggest you to have a lot of energy and be preparated. For example at the job alot of employees that against you because they said that you are idle, and you dont want to do nothing. Insted that the employees at your job dont know that you are tired because you have two jobs.

Some people, students or parents lived so tire and they look idle. At my house we live all togethers and sometime i dont to do nothing at my house. My parents argument me that i dont clean the house. For example that i dont study or help my mom with my little brother. In addition my family doesnt know that i have tow jobs because i want to help her to play the rent of the house, that why some people lookd idle or tired.

They are some friends that they teach you and they support you to be a better person with good behaviour those people want you to be how great you are doing something productive. Neverles, some friends want you to be like them with bad reputation. For example unemplayment, without money, you need to be reponsibility of your acts.

In conclusion, it doesnt matter if other people are telling you idle or unemplayment, they are time that it is hard to find a job or you just want to rest because you are tire, it is wonderful to know that how much may be done if are always doing something;Therefore, some people think that does inactivity also serve a purpose. In my opinion they should be doing somthing at life to receive a good pupose in your life.
