Dear Generic_Name

It is a honor for me to respond your statement about human individuality and I agree with your statement and i believe that be yourself in a world is hard. The world is something that the human we can not answer and be yourself is definitely the same is hard everything is hard but you can get a lot achievements for do and treat the best the you can.

First, I think the when you are alone and the city or other place and you got this situation you are alone there is not family, friends, parents nobody is there but you have to be sure that you can live without people that grow and start think what is going to happen. I believe that everyone can do everything that we want each achieve or something else because everyone can be smart, we are the people that we wanna be and yes if you are alone in the a big world you are going to scared first you have to work and pay everything that you want but that is help you to get the greatest accomplshment.

Second, be yourself is everything that all people want because to can express the real person that you are not a fake person cause if you are in a meeting or school or whatever place you have to be yourself and demonstrate the person who are you inside the feeling the you have all the characteristics that you have the point is to desmonstrate the world the you can be yourself and make more to get something else and be something else.

Next, desmonstrate the person who are you one reason is you can get more friends because your are showing to other person who real you are.

In clonclusion, be yourself in a world is more better then not we have to continue trying the person who wanna be for get more achievements and other things. Thanks for give me this opportunity to response you what i think and give you my opinion.

Sincerely.
