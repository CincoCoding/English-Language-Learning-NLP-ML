People say, having a positive attitude is the key to a success in life.

I strongly agree with them, if you come to think about it been positive may give you the corage to do surtend things.

You would belive in yourself and most possiblie make your goals come true.

It also would be hard for you to get your feelings hurt.

People wont be able to brake you down that easily.

So in my personal opinion, having a possitive attitude actually is the key to a success in life.

When i said it gives you the corage to do surtend things i mean it.

Because, you might want to make a goal in you life come true, but your probably to shy or your thinking "oh theres no way im going to make it".

Thats the main problem, you have a negative energy witch bring you to have a negative action.

Sometimes your words reflect your actions.

This is why i think if you have a possitive attitude you will sucess in life.

Been positive or having a positive energy is like the meaning of "faith".

Lets talk about why i mention "faith".

Having faith makes you believe in yourself'

When you have a negative attitude your of course going to have a negative action.

But in many religions if you have faith everything is possible.

This is why i compare these two words, that are very similar to each other.

So if you have "Faith" you must have a possitive attitude.

Having a positive attitude can help you out emotionaly too.

If your possitive at all times no matter what people say about you it wont hurt you as bad.

The reason i belive it wont hurt you as bad is because, you would believe in your self and wont let other negative attitude ruin yours.

For example, if i say to myself "Man i alredy know i aint going to pass this test , i aint even going to try".

Oviosly im going to fail because, having a negative energy reflects not to even try.

So if you want to sucess in life like i do, you should try to change your attitude and try been positive at all times.
