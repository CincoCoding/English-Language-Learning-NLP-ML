I believe and agree with self-esteem comes from achievement because i've learned this from experience .The people who believe in the students must be self-confident in order to learn statement really didnt think this through when they agreed to that . self-confidence really cant really be used or proved to learn better . Achieving anything like a win in a sport or something positive you get at the end can boost your self-esteem. achieving something or having a positive outcome after doing something can really make students think twice on how they shouldnt give on things and also boosting self-confidence too but just mostly self-esteem. I really have no idea what i'm doing or writing neither not knowing what self-esteem is all i know its something to do with your thoughts or emotions. I only typed in what i know and what I think is the best response to this stupid prompt that made me stress out more and waste my time doing nothing and only sit here and think what can I type that makes sense that closely answers the prompt and really all I did wastype and give it a statement and repeated with different words , I already know Im going to fail this wellI atleast tried and put in effort . In my conclusion achievements are the best way ,for motivating people to keep going and never give up and somehow in some way relate to self-esteem.
