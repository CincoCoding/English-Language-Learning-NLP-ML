The Author Waldo Emerson wrote "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment". I agree with Waldo Emerson's quote because if theres someone thats trying to make you something that your not, being yourself will be a very duanting task. When I was in the 8th grade someone who I thought was one of my friends wanted me to change who I was because they though that I was'nt cool enough to hangout with anymore, at first i thought that I was the problem, but I learned that true friends won't try to change who you are, no mather what. Being yourself is one of the hardest things you can try to do, possible because your to shy, you don't think your good enough, your scared of what others will think of you.

I always hated thinking about myself because i never though that I was good enough for anyone or good enough to do anything, so I kept everything bottled up inside, at one point or another I even thought about killing myself but was to scared to do antthing to try anything. So I decided acted like everything was ok untill I tricked my self into belaveing that I was happy, but that did'nt last. Now i'm in the 11th grade I came across a certen individuality(my current girlfriend) who, when I around, can't stop feeling real happyness. Everyday I think about how lucky I am to have met her. The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, as an individual I agree with his quote because in this world not everone wants to see you sucssed in your efferts.
