But , Kahoot keeps the kids more active when they are learning and gives the teacher better controll of the kids. Also,kahoot is easy to teach with because when kids use paper and books the teacher has to go to the kids one by one just to correct their mistakes but when the teachers are using kahoot they can explain the right answer faster and better in front of the whole class.

Teachers who use papers and books are always tried because they have to grade them, one by one and can't go home untill their done and teachers somtimes get really lazy. But, when teachers are using kahoot to teach it easy to see who did it and who did not do it and they do not get so tried and when the teachers are not tried they can teach better .
