Its not a good idea for students to identiify a career by the time they enter high school. The three reasons are because it can cause to much stress on the student, they wont be able to focus on their school work, and it can unmotavite them to succesed in their careeer. If the student is expected to identify a career by highschool it can affect how their doing in school becuse all they will be thinking about is a career to pick. They wont focus on their work in class or pay attention in class which will make them fail and slump the class. That can unmotavite them and they can stop showing to school and drop out. Those are my reasons on why I think making a student choose a career by highschool is bad. Others might argue that a student who has a career in mind by the time they enter highschool will succesed because they know what they want to do in life. It will guide them to success in the future, they will have all highschool to study about their career they chose. However, that might work on some students but it wont work on all bacause not everyone knows what they wanna be in life. Some drop out of school cause of the stress it puts on them and just start working to make money. Those are my reasons why I think we shoudn't pressure students on choosing a career so early in high school.
