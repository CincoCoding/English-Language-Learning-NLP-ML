Dear Sir or Madam:

Yes school should control students involvement in extracurricular activities, If they're doing terribly in school. If a student is doing terrible in school and he is in so many extracurricular activities, The School should take action right away. If the student has no time to study and involved in so many activities the student is defenitely going trough something. For example: The student's familymight be going trough rough times and he does not want to come home early, and Also he might be avoiding someone at home.

Second reason School's should control student involvement in extracurricular activities. because the Student has no time to study and the student is in so many school activities that is going to result to a bad grade. If the student has bad grades the Student is going to be stress about school and The student might ended up dropping out of school. If the student drop out of highschool it is not going to be easy for him to find a good paying job.

That is the reason why school's should take control of students involvement in extracurricular activities. If they do take control of the students with bad grades the it's in a club. They should be taken out of the club and help the student to get his grades up, and if he does he he get to join the club. Every students should earn it by having good grades.
