should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matter? one of the common questions i get ask. Many people have different thoughts about this questions,

my opinion is depending the sittuation. For example people can learn from there dicision but in other hand listening to people's advice can stop you from doing wrong. Ever since i was little i always wanted to make my own decision and wont have to listen to no one but i the more i got older i realized that sometimes what people say to do can turn out to be better then the decision you took. Making your own decision can make you more independent and know how life works and those are the people we look up too. Depending on the situation your in listening to others give us life lesson can be one of the most unforgetables momments because that show you they care and want the best for you because maybe they didnt end up making the right decision and want you to prevent from doing it .
