I believe that schools should allow the students to graduate in traitional four years,

instead of three years because If some of the student faill the class or the SOL, they should a time to retake those classess they faill. Most of the students dont what to take a courses during the summers. Some students want to take a elective courses in schools not in summers chas as a art, muise, and language they want.

I personily believe students graduate in four years because they will have time to retake a class or SOL if they need to do. I think it's head for some of the student to work and graduate in three years instead of four years. The most immopat think is that if the students faill a class they can't graduate the hight schools befor they pass the class they faill.

Most of the student's don't want to take a courses during the summer because they want to have free time , they don't want to work on summers. Some students work and save some money for college. They don't want to work for schools on summers. They're some family who love traveling with they're kids.

Most of the students want to take a elective courses but not in summer. Couses whay want to take is art, muise, and language they want. Some of the classes that students take as a elective courese can help them in college or in work force. Some of the elective courese that students take can help them find out what they like or dislike.

Overall my position on this issue is that schools should offer a four years hight schools, instead of three years because it's can hlpe students to get ready for college and work.
