Do you think educational activity's can be enjoyable? I think they are because I like science experiments and I love when I do them myself. And sometimes I play tennis witch is pretty fun. When i was in the sixth grade I was in band and strings class and I

played the drums and the viola that was my favorite until i got to the eight grade I started to play the trumpet and I liked it.

first of all, I like to do science experiments and one time in seventh grade I dissected a frog and it was fun. Once I was in the fifth grade and I put a gummy bear in a cup of water and it got bigger. In the eight grade i made ice cream and it was fun but it was so cold.

furthermore, and the sports that I play are fun to because I play tennis and wrestling. They are very fun and i like tennis more because I got hurt more in wrestling then tennis. And most of my friends do tennis and I like that. And I have more fun around my friends.

finally, In sixth grade I was in band and I was in strings class. I played the drums in math class and I played the viola in strings class I was very good at the instrument but I stopped in seventh grade. But in the eight grade I started to play the trumpet and I liked it I think I can play that instrument better than the viola and the drums.

in the conclusion, Do you think educational activity's can be enjoyable? I think they are because I like science experiments and I love when I do them myself. And sometimes I play tennis witch is pretty fun and wrestling. When i was in the sixth grade I was in band and strings class and I

played the drums and the viola that was my favorite until i got to the eight grade I started to play the trumpet and I liked it.
