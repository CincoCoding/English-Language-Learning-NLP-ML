I agree because is important to have a positive attitude, and it is better to be positive thant negative, because if someone want to talk to you, an want some advise and him give your a negative answer, the other person will be negative, but is the person give him a positive answer then the other person will be be happy, and will try to do his best to stay positive, but some people don't like to be positive, and always are beind a negative person on everything, they are person that if you tell them something, they will answer angry, and dont like to make friendship, for example if your are new in a school, and you dont have friends then, you will try to make friends in a positive way, and it will work because you are dont beind a negative person to others, second example is that the person is someone negative and the other person also, they will be fights and discussion on each other, that's why people have to be positive and sure one everthing
