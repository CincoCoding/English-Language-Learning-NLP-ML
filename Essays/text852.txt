I'm agree which this to say the first impression is impossible to change,To be honest whicth my self friends and people etc... , Be direct with the other person , Say the true and respecful, Be comprehensible , understand the another person,

some day of this week my friend bring a pants and i'm saw him, my fist empression was ''naa this not going which you , so i will honest with him , if somebody tell me something that is not pleasing for me i'm sure that i going to put my impression face , and maybe the other person don't like, but it's impossible to change my impression , I will direct which the people ,if the people don`t like my impression i'm sorry for them, yeah maybe it's not correct to say the fist impression , i'm agree for that too, and i understand that some people put angry when i do that , but i can't change my actituded because i'm like this, it's the same with the another people they got them own impression but in different ways , that's fot that i'm agree , and i understand that is so important to me beacuse i don't know if the other person feel bad when i say the first impression , that's why i need to improve my impression , some people and my friends are annoying with me for this , and that's why i need to practice respect to myself and the another people.

The fist impression is bad idea because if i'm in the job and my boss tell me that my work is not like this, and i say my fist impression that's sure that my boss will put annying because maybe he try to teach me, and the fist thing that i do is my impression and is not a good imprression,

some impression are good because when somegirl look beautiful my impression going to be wow i like how they look today , so impression can be good or bad,

the impression can used in different ways, can use in possitive and negative forms so we decide what kind of impression to used , but a lot a time we only used a negative impression in that is not correct , for example if i or some friend bring something or do something we need to do an possitive impression but we always give a negative impression and that is not correct we need to encourage this person but we only do negative things.

Having a godd impression we are more than we can imagene because everybady respect to you and nobody got problem with you , and thats a opportunities to alot of ways in your life .
