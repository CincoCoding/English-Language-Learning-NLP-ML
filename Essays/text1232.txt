I think students, parents, and including me wouldn't like the idea of adding a hour and half of a hour each day of the school thats why I disagree with the idea of extending the day of school because students have other things to do like pick up little brothers or sisters and take of them, help mom and dad with the house, do another type's of activities because if students are only thinking about school all the time we can stress out a lot and there's no rule that says that students can't have fun also we are in school for about 7 or 8 hours so i think thats enough.

First of all some of the students have little brothers and sisters and the parents work and they dont have the chance to pick up they kids because they get out of the work late, so the orders sibling haves to take care of they little brothers and sisters also little kids from elementary schools can't get out of the bus without someone picking them up, so the older siblings have to pick them up or else the little kids are going back to school and they get scared because they are the only one who are in the school and they are little so they don't know what's going on so that is one reason why we cant be in school more hours not even half of a hour.

Secondly students have to help they parents with the house how i said parents came from work late and they dont have time for nothing so students have to help them by cleaning the house, cook for they sibling and parents , they have to wash the dishes, wash they clothes, clean the rooms, some of the students have dogs and they have to go with them for a walk or take them to the doctor so when parents get home they can lay down and chill because they work really hard and all the students can do is helping doing the cleaning that is the second reason why we can't be at school more than we supposed to be.

Finally some students have another type of activities after school like dancing, soccer practice and soccer game's, basketball practice and basketball game's, step teams, community service, etc also that helps a lot to get your mind out of thinking about homework's, test's, classwork, so you dont stress out a lot because being honest sometime students have a lot of homework and test to do in each class and after school is the only time where you can get you'r mind out of school and also we are having fun for a little time because some parents are kind off strict and they don't let they kids to be outside after 8:30.

In conclusion we can't be in school more than 8 hours because all the students have more activities to do and have fun for a little time and we have responsibilities at home helping parents cleaning and taking care and picking up little siblings and we can stress out a lot if we spend more than 8 hours in school because that means more work to do and we would be only student and we would be tired because also we are not going to have time to chill and i know that no one is going to be happy about it because teachers have they children as well parents need the help of they kids and students need they own time so these are my reasons of why I disaree of adding a hour and half of a hour.
