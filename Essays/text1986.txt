like mine. My skill is talking to people. I don't know why I like to talk to other people but i just do. But It can get me in trouble like. When Im doing a test I like to turn around and talk to my friends and i always get in trouble for this. or when Im in class I like to talk to much with my friends and not do my work and sometimes I talk to the teacher for a long time and not do my work. Talking to other people can be a good thing you like not being shy. I used to be shy but i start talking to people and became not being as shy as I used. There are more ways that talking can be good for like building a good friendship with other people like least year. I started talking to other people this year and made a lot of new friends. And you can become best friends with the teacher it a good thing to have a good friendship with the teacher. Talking can help you with making new friends out of school. like at birthday party you can talk to people you don't even know. talking is a good skill to have because. it can help you with the real world. Like when you see some one have a bad day you come and talk to them and make them feel better then they were. my skill can be good or bad at sometime. but that my skill.
