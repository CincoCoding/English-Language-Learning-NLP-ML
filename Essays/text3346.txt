Yes agree with it, because if you fail one time you will try to do it in a different way, but you never have to loss your enthusiasm if you have a goal you need try to to get it otherways you will never make it always try to do your best never let anybody tell you what to do anything can be possible.

when i was young i wanted to be good at soccer but when i play with my cousings they allways make fun of me, and i stare crying i never try to be good a soceer never. then i was always staying after to play with peolpe at my age, I was getting better and better at soccer, and after like one year after i went to my aunt house my cousings told me to play with then, they were surprise because better then they.

When i first came to USA all my family was tellimg to learn english. First when i was learning a little be of english, and my teacher told me to practice english in the class (talk to others students in class), but i was scare that the student make fun of me, so that day i did not spoke english in class i told my self ( i going to learn and make my self proud)

at the end of the school year my english was better i was always epeaking english with my sister and to my teachers too.

Others people think taht if you can"t do something you have to stop doing it or stop trying, others will told you that you can"t do it, but remember you can do everything you propouse .

So if you want to do something just do it don't be afraid of failing doesn't matter if you fail you can keep trying to do it make your family proud meke your self proud. Life is beautiful try to get your goals done. And remember you can do anything you want just if you try really hard. At the end you will remember all of the people who told you that you will fail, and the people that always believe on you.
