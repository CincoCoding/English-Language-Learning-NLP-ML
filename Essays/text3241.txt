I agree what Emerson is talking about because nobody should ever tell you that you can not be yourself or feel wrong about them self. if you want to be a doctor then go head make your dream come true or if you want to be a nurse then go head do not let anyone stop you because at the end of the day your the who wants to make your dream come true and who wants to be a better person in life and who wants to make your family proud of you of, what you have become, what you have been working hard for. if you want to be a nurse then you will need to work really hard and study if you want to get to that level and to that point. if people do not like who you are and they think bad about you do not let to them bring you down keep doing you prove to them that you do not need them in your life and that you can do better without them

Because your the one who wants to be a better person in life. if people wanna say stuff behind your back igone them beacuse they are the ones who are gonna feel bad about them self.
