So this is what the Countergraument is about and what it onces me to take the Position and Issue on is this Should people make their own Decisions, or should they seek Guidance from experts and Authorities about life's Important matters?

People should make their own decisons because in one point of another theres always going to be a time that we are going to have to make a decison on something like for example every four year's theres always a selection for a new goverment and what i mean by new Goverment i mean like a new President that when we have to make a Selection that a decison that we are making for our self but in this situation we are looking for our own Committing benenfical so that why it is good for us to star making our own decisons for our own self and specially for us as young Atults that we are in high school and that some of right now we are asking some bad choices but we can change that by staring making good decisons or at list trying to make the right decison in school.
