To conserve energy and resources, some bussines have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consist of ten hours. In my opinion, this idia would bring benefits for some students and disavantages too. For example the students who really like the school it would be a great idia, to be doig team-progets or just spend time with friends and teachers. In the other hand some students don't really like to be 8 hours in the school so I just realize that they would not agree with that idea.

A mayor porcent of the students wo don't like school, decide to quit or just apply to an elective shool. Like in my case olmost 1 year ago i decide to start going to an elective school, the reason is that I work a full tme job after school and it was difficult to arrive on time everyday to the basic school. I thing the idea of adding 2 hours more to the schedule of the basic school is not a good idia, because students who are in the high school and have a job as a part-time or even a full time would decide to apply to a basic school. I mean a basic school is better for the students who work at the same time they canmake their schedule smaller and have enough time to sleep, work, and to study. In conclusion, this is my point of view.
