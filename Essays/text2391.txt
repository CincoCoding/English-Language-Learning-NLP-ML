Churchill consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, he said that because he wants to animate people to not be shy of anything and I'm agre with that.

Some say Churchill go from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm because sometimes people feel shy when they are doing somehing that they don't want to do, like me. I'm so shy when I have to do presentations, I don't feel confortable. But we have to get out our fears, that are killing us to not do what we have to do. People sometimes said that they going somewhere but they said that they don't want to go alone because he/she feels weird, like if you are new in this country, they tell maybe to their cousins to go with him/her.

People should be agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success because that makes you feel successed and that makes you to be a good person. Actually, Churchill said that because he want to people to not loose their enthusiasm in something that they want and that is a good choose.

People should not be agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success because I think people don't want to do want Churchill said in the statement and they are not going to follow the statement . Actually, people is not agree because people think that is not importat statement for them and thats why people are not agree with the statement.

In conlusion, people should be agree with Churchill statement because he don't want to people to loose their enthusiasm, that's hy people are agree with the Chuchill important statement because they feel success.
