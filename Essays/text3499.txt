The author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

Why the author Waldo Emerson wrote. Unless you you try something beyond what you have already mastered. you will never grow. The author want to let the people know that there's many way to grow up. The people should think about to do different stuff even if they are mastered in any profession.

Does Mr. Emerson thought about the people when he wrote his message in his text. Yes he does. He thought a bout it because he clearly is talking to the people in his writing. People shouldn't stop learning other stuff or do other kinds of work because they are professional in one job. I agree with Mr. Emerson about his writing. Many people in society just want to focus in one thing. but that affect the development of the community of work. Also if you never try something new you will never know. and if you do not try you are closing you mind and the opportunity to learn. The people should think about to grow up.

In my conclusion the people should try something else. The society shouldn't be focus in just one stuff all life. The community would be better if we keep going a head. and think about the future.
