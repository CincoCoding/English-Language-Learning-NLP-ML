There is one place I would like to visit is Generic_City because that is a beautiful country there is really great people. At night is really beautiful if you live in a apartment you can see how beautiful it is when i'm bigger i'm going to Generic_City with my girl because I love that country and it's a awesome country. The food there is really good and at night you can go in the water with someone it's really fun.

The boats are big and small you can ride them and you can relax. I don;t know how much you have to play to ride them all I know is that they are really nice to ride. And I want to go and get on the Eiffel it's really high up and you can see everything. At night the Eiffel it lights up and it;s really cool because you can see it from ever were because it's really high up.

Theres and elevator do that you can go really high in the Eiffel you my take some time because it's really high and there my be going a lot of people so you have to take an other ride. For me it's better to look at night because of the lights it's really cool. At day time it nice but it dose't have the lights so I like it when it's night time. But the thing I don't like about night time it's that you can go but in the elevator.

The food is really good they eat a lot of things they eat bread at any time of day. They have cafe's there are really good. But Paris is really different form a lot of country's. They have really good chafes that make really good food that you are going to love. They have awesome food.
