I thinks is decions of everyone because if you are smart and if you want to graduation in three year just you have to focuse and give your best and you have the decion in your hands if your decion is yes so do it, because another students can`t do it or din`t like, so i think is opecional, for my selfel i think is greet idea just take three year of the high school but i know is not easy becuase take the high school in three year is very complicate becuase you well have to take course duging the summers and may not be able to take elective couses, but you advance is good.

Reasons. (why is good)

becuase is good for you live because you have one year early and this can help you to do it a greet estudent and with this year early you can go to the college early or you can work one year and after this year you can star the college, and if your finis the high school in three year that mean you are a good estudent and thats can help you because you can find a programs that can help you, because if you want to go to the college the college is not chip and for follow your dream you have find a solucion and the solucion is give you best.

Example. Because if you find a programs that can help you, so you can follow what you want to do it in a future.

If you are a bad students and you GPA is so down you can`t go to the college becuase for going to college, I think you GPA have to do more the 3.00 for you can go a good callege.

Thats why I think is good take the high school in three year, because you can have more oportunidis for well have a good future.

Conclution.

Yes is good idea that students to finish high school in three years becuase is something like well better for you futuere, in your live. But everything is your decision you know what you want to do with life and if you don`t know what you want to do just think about in you future and thats you can find the enswer and belive in yourself that you can do it. because the education is very important.
