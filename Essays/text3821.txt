An old proverb says honesty is the best policy, but what happen if the policy with being honest at all time. The policy can help people to making decisons in they life. The policy making by goverment and citizen need to following that but not mean you need to follow all. Last year, I have a best friend she has a nice charater like honesty , helpfull, good with everyone.... I talk with her about my parent, my sister, what i like or what i hate, i tell her everythings about me and i think she can keep those my clandestine because we are friend. But not, she so honest, somebody ask about those my clandestine to tease me and she answer all, about mine, my clandestines for they and i will be laughing stock with everyone." Honesty is a best policy", honesty is a nice charater but you don't need to being honest at every place and every time. A fantasy men invite me to buy somethings for him, and i believe him because i am so honest and i think everyone will be good and honesty as me. Finally, i know him trick me but now i cannot do anything because him drop off. ....Sometime you need withstand, forceful, don't believe anything or anyone because you don't know what they want and give out your decision by your self. I think honesty it is nice quality and it need to be on each person but not that mean we being honest at all time.
