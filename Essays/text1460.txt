I think that it's a bad idea to put more hours of school beacause after school people,students and teachers have to do important stuff like take there kids to soccer or go to a doctors appointment and thats the only time that we have free to do are important missions and there are teacher's that live far they could live in Generic_City and other places that are far. And if we make it longer there are going to be parent's that are going to be waiting for there child to take them to the football, soccer games and then when they come home its going to be late beacause like they want to change the hours they are not going to have enough time to do anything there going to go home to homework and then when you know it it arleady like 8pm and you have to go to bed. And we arleady wake up at 7am and then coming back home and it's like 5pm-6pm it's stress out kicking out stuff that you do but now you can't to beacause they put more time in School.

And i think it sucks beacause there are kids that go to my school that live in Generic_City and it take along time to come to school and go back home from school beacause i've lived in Generic_City before and it suck when i stay after school i get home like at 7pm-8pm and it's sucks so it better to not make school longer beacause there are kid that live pretty far and there are going to get home late and then they have to get there homework done too. so it's dummy hard work to get that on time. And us as chidren its going to ruined are shecdule and are parent's to maybe we have not go to soccer or any activity that we take just beacause they put more time in school it going to suck being in a class room for 80 mintues now. it's to be trieding.

They meant if we get a half an hour of more school they start giving us more homework then we mostly get and doing that for just 3 hours that we get just beacause they want to add more time it's going to be hard for everybody and they teacher if they live far it's going to be hard beacause at 6pm thats when all rush hour are so much traffic and there going to come home late and when they come home late there going to be grading work and then waking up at 5pm to go back to work and that trieding doing that smae rountine for there whole life it hard I dont even go to work and i'm like wow if that happens it going to be bad.

Another thing that why would should have on more half an hour is beacause we wake up early and have another half hour kicking ints not far if they want to do that they should a least change they school time and wake up like at 8am or something beacuase its not far wake up early and then leaving so late it should be the oppsite wake up late and leave school early it going to be better beacause then everybody going to kbe happeir no one is going to be in a bad mood and it's going to be chill and then .

Anothe thing way we should have an half an hour of school left it's beacause we the 8th grader we get lunch at 1:40 and then haveand half and hour of school were going to have lunch at 2:10 or something I arleadly hate that and i dont wanna be starving beacause then i wont to my work beacause how hungry I i'm going to get mad i'm going to get hangry and having busdriver taking the kid home at 6pm its going to suck beacause they need there time too for they could do stuff and have time with there family's and there going back and forth it sucks for them having ti puck up kids late and stuff and taking them home.
