Do you agree or disagree whith Emerson's statement about individuality ? Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ,to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment ." I disagree with Emerson's statement about individuality .

my first important why I disagree whith Emerson's statement about individuality :

the humen, or the person, if he whant to be the greatest accomplishment i don't think he can be greatest accomplishment by hemself because he need help from shool or the teacher because you cant do that whithout help .

to be the greatest accomplishment you shoulde to study, or work whith groups not only if you work only you cant understanding you cant investigation your dream .

the work with groups that will help you to know our life that will help you to be greatest accomplishment my most important reason why i disagree whith Emerson's statement about individuality ;

To be th greatest accomplishment you need to study about what you whant to be you need to learn a lot of things about the world and every thing about the world you shoulde be the best one on the earth in conclusin , why i disagree whith Emerson's statement about individuality because he cant be the greatest a ccomplishment to be your self in aworld that is constantly .
