It's better to have an elective class because it simple, forgiving and doesnt take skills doesn't take time in the schedule and more Students will likely to pass the classes and both elective and art have the same principle with the same accomplishment. The difference about the two is art classes and electives how they would set a skills some sudents have good skills in drawing or writing it will take student time on school work than outside job that they working on; Art classes are hands on class is for students who wants advanced skills in writing or any type of work or job related to technology or language skills, good scholarship and art classes not for students who procastinate than doing their work. As My i would prefer elective classes because it doesnt get my school work on my path and I have to complete it. elective class helps students who doesnt have time to do their work also benfit any students to have jobs outside of schools. Some students in elective class can have the same credits for graduation same as the art class but more students would rather have elective beacue ii is much more relax than getting alot of class work in front;

As a student i would rather have an elective class ,
