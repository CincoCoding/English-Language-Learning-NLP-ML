PROMPT

Prompt is somthing that can we done everything but some times somthiny bad can happen, we have to thik fisrt, before to do something.

First in my opinion, for me is bad, because no all time yo can be lat, also if you have excuse or a reason why you are lat, but we have to be prompt, for instanse some times people are lazy, and is not good, por example if you going lat in your job probale lose your work , or if you get up 7:30am in the morning and your bus raisin

7:35am again you lost the bus, according how you are, especially we can be lazy.

Especially always we need to be prompt because is necessary, in different place where you go. you need to be the first person, but no't the all peron are prompt, some people have a excuse,

but we can accomplish if you want, and if you can, also some people have a lot of things to do, but we can meke a calendar, and be more responsible, we can take the time for different things to do, also looking you watch or clock.

Then we can give a good example, prove a good prompt, also one thing in the life, and more important is the promt, but for mi some times is impossible, when I lose the bus school, one thing how to change this, for this get up more early, and take the time, aslo we have 24 hours is so a lot of, we can do the all things, depend how you want to live, if you can't to live runing all time, is because you are lazy or other reason.

For intsanse the prompt, all time you have in your life, when you have a appoiment, when you need to go in your job, also when you need to go in the school, when you need to go in the church, when you need to go in the court, you can lose that things. in other words alwasy you need to be prompt, is very important. we need to do the all things.
