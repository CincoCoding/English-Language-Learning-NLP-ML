I agree with this statement becaues I think that unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow in you life. some poeple try very hard to mastered thing in there life. for examples poeple will try there best do mastered something in there life and with there friend and family.

first some poeple try very to mastered something there life they are not good that. and poeple try to be a good friend to there best firend. poeple try very hard, to keep there jod and to not get fire for there job becaues they need the money to pay bill at home and food to there famliy.

at lest poeple, if you try to do somethig beyong you will not never grow in life. poeple go beyond thing at they are not good at and the try very hard be at end they fail and get sad about it. some friend are good at mastered vidoe game and they play vey day. some friend get mad wind they loss and then they get into a fight just beaues they loss to a video game.
