A lesson that i would share would be that some thing the would befinfit there lives like how to be good in school,because if you wanna be someone in life you have to go to school and get your education. because most job look your grades in school and a diploma and if you wanna go to college you can get soclerships. And how to get good grades is to turn all your work in to the teachers and dont turn it late because that takes your points off and you dont want that and if you dont turn it in that will bring your grade down by a lot until it is a zero and you diffidently dont want that and how not to get in trouble is when a teacher ask you do something do it because they are to only going to tell you once only then after that is in school suspension and you dont want that because it is boring and it goes in to your record well i dont that or you dont want that ether so just what your are asks and DONT talk back to a teacher the rude and not nice .that the lesson that wanted to give you.
