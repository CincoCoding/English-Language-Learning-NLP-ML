it's a gtood idea for us the students, like that we could know what we want to study when we be graduated from the high school. we have a lot of time to think about it. I would like to study for pilot, so i can try to choose one class to be related about that and learn about how to drive an airplane.

But, Not all the schools has these benefits and also because some students don't have how to go to these schools and all of us students do not can go to any high school. I think that's the only bad thing because if you drive, you just can go and then back your home and some times if someone is giving to you ride is good as well but it's not gonna be every time then you would have to find who can take you to school and who can pick you up from the school.

Well I think we the student to commit to a career at a young age is well because we can be graduated more early.

the good news is if you go to thats schools you can learn more and choose what do you wanna study for college thats a good point and also you may have a lot of opportunities, In some high schools you needed have good grade for going there and passing clases too.

in others words if you don't have a good grades you can't sign for that schools.

You needed be prepare every time, If you do, You can study in the best university and achieve your dreams.
