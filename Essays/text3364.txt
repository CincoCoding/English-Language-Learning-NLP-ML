The outdoor activities parks, get people to know each other better. The activities outside is fun, because you get to meet new people, where there is always competition and competitors. The main thing what makes an activity fun, is the enthusiasm of the people, having an enjoyable moment. However, how people or siblings cheered for you and others for the other team, is sensational. In Conclusion that's what makes a game great, the fact that has many memorable moments, that you will never forget.

In general, activities exercises your body, ounce you get use to running ,or playing sports. Techniqually, you wanna do more when you really like the activity that your doing, thats enthusiam for a motivation.
