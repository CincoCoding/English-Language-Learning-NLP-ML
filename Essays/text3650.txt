I try to do my best to Accomplish everything, i can as fast i can to catch up. Not being active its not good nor healthy, and It wouldn't help you progress in future reference. it helps you to be more prepare and organize and. ready for everything. Always have a mindset goal, realistic goals, and measurable.

We do Accomplish more if we're doing something, keeping yourself occupied. Sometimes when you're not doing nothing, (meaning) being inactive, It's to rest for an amount of time. To think and, analize our point of views and,ideas.

"Determine to never be Idle" (meaning lazy) I know there's time when we all want to be lazy and not doing nothing, but thats not get you no where near your Goals. As Thomas Jefferson said " It's Wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing".
