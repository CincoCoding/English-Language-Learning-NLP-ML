School's should not exend a school day by two hours and have a three day weekend. Just to conserve energy and and resources. Students would have to work a lot harder. Student would also have more resonsibility.

Student already hate school and are already really tired when they get home from an seven hour school day. So whyadd another two hours to there day. This would cause a kid alot more stress because of the extra amount of work they would have to do, keeping there grade up and staying fouces on there school work. Plus they would still have to come home and do there homework or any work they didnt finish in class.

Also some student might have a lot more of resonibility to do and adding another two hours would just stress them out with the amount of work. Like what if the kid was doing some after school activites, the kid would be to tired to do any clubs or sports. Students would also be unmotivated to get job because they would have the time or enegry to work.

Some would say that it would a good idea to extend the school days by two hours because of the extra day off they'll get, and because of all the energy and resourcs they'll be saving, but wearing out the kids by giving them extra work to do. Stressing them out moreis not worth it.

So in conclusion I dont think school's should extend there days and give us another day off. It would be to stressful and to tiring. Student need time to go home after school and rest, and have a few days to rest.
