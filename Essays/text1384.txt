If we work together the more we learn. From partnership you can learn and hear what other people come up with. I chose partnership because of diccuse in groups, work in groups, and learn more.

First, discusing in groups is one thing that partnership is. If one person doesn't get something another person can come up with other ideas. If I came up with new ideas i can share my ideas with the group i'm in. People can also hear what another student can up with in their own ways. Students can also correct themselves if they messed up on a word.

Second, working in groups is another idea of working with partners. People can help one another if they are having trouble understanding something. I can also learn new things just by hearing what a student came up with. In a group we can also check each others paper to see what they came up with. We can all work together to come up with new ideas so that our paper makes sence.

Third, by learning more we can get the hang of using that learn strategy. Coming up with new ideas to improve our writing. In group we can talk about each others paper if we think there should be a puncuation ore if a word is spelled wrong. If someone didn't puncuate a sentence correctly we can find a good puncuation to place it so that it would sound right. we acn also revise our paper to each other and hear what each others paper needs correction.

In conclusion, working in groups, learning more, and discuse in groups are reasons why i chose partnership. Working with partners brings new ideas in each others work.
