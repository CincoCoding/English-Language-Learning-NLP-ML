Which is better Working with a group or working alone, Somepeople may say working in a group is more Beneficial than working all alone. By

Sharing answers, Help each other if stuck in proplem, and get to finish on Time

.

First, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because sharing answers helps me learn New thins to learn about new answers to thing about because I,m not that good in English speaking, For example i got Generic_Name, My English 11 Teacher Gives the hole class a paper to Read and answer, By the time i finish reading i ask my tracher if i could let Generic_Name to be my partner so we could help each other and get it done on time by helping each other and share our answer to see a diffrent thoughts of each one of us,

Secondley, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because Its fun to work with a person or more, For example in History Class, when the teacher got to let us do class work for tomorrow exam or test, she let us do a group of 4 and do a challege in a computer so we could learn and do fun in the same time.

Third, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone. Because Students could finish their work on time, Foe Example Last week me and Generic_Name we got a project is Due in two day in History class, We worked together and reachers a diffrent thing and write a diffrents thought and even diffrent answers and we compond all of our answers and finish on time with diffrents thoughts.

Conclution, Some people may say Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, But Sometime i like to work a lone because i could think of my answers and question and even could get my own grade but sometimes when i work in a group when i try to work and care about my work but the rest of my grop does not care so if no body has worked then the hole group will get a zero even the person who worked.
