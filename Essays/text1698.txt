i am disagree with this because, is going to have a negative effect because, you are going to lose the comunication with the people.

first reason: you can't go out side to shop.

example:when i was in my country, i was going to the store, i was go in my bike or walk but when i move to the united states i don't need to go because, my mom just call to the store and they bring the prouct or food.

second reason: play games with your friends.

example: the last week, i ask to one of my friend who live in my home country if they continue play games like soccer in the soccer field or anther game in the street , he tell that now they play populars games in the phone and they don't like play games in the street enymore.

third reason: the little boys don't want to do others thing just stay in the phone.

example: my little brother who is to years old, he just want to watch videos on the phone, when my mom take the phone he cry because he want to watch videos or play games on the phone he don't do other things, he don't play with my other brother.

fourth reason:

go to visit family or other places.

example:when i go to visit my family or other places i can leave my phone because everytime we go to visit my family i be bored. and when wi go to visit new places i like to take pictures of the place.

fifth reason: you will be a addicted with your phone or computer.

example: i have a friend here in the school who use the phone in the class, sometimes he is play games , some times he watch videos, when the teacher look at him he is in the phone she tell him to put on his packet or in the back pack but he never do it, some times he sit on the back of the room so the teacher can't see him.
