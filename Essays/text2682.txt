Identifying a career at a young age.

Identifying a career at a young age may be difficult for some students ,most of them think different ,some of them doesn't even care about their future or what they are going to do with their life ,parents may think this is a good idea because they want a good life and good future for their childrens and want them to be successfull and this will change their perspective of thinking.

Although some people think that this idea is a bad idea , and this is going to be hard for students,because the students are going to have more homework,projects,test to get prepared for their career and some quizzes too,Actually people this days is use to only if the students gratuated and get out of school is when they have to start thinking on what the students want to do or work , for example if students finish high school and they start to work in a regular work like a restaurant,they may think i'm already here working good ,I get pay good ,why would I go to school again,I don't need to go school again just to spend money ,I'm good like that just getting my own money to wasted only for me,and this would be the way he is thinkg because when he was in high school; people didn't talk to him about careers when he was at school.

One reason for start identifying what students want at a young age is because they would have a lot of time to think what they really want in their life ,for example if a student is in 9 grade and he says I want to be a police and then he is in 11 grade and he think different and he wants to be a doctor,he would a chance to change his career because he had time to do it , another example i can give if like what is a student want to start knowing how his career work, like the doctor career he may wanna know how much credits he need to make in high school , how many years his career is going to take ,if he is going to have the opportunity to go collage, would he be able to pay his career,that's why is a good idea to start thinking at a young age,and start to getting prepare for what he is going to do in his career.

Another reason for start thinking what the students want in their life,is that they may know on what they are good at,to know their self,and start to think if they are going to be successfull in their future ,they may start doing good in high schoool to do credits and try to get a scholarship ,for example the student finish high school and he is going for his career maybe a doctor and at the middle of his preparation for being a doctor he saids I'm not good at this and this career is not going to a successfull for me I would only give up a this point , he may think this way because he didn't have opportunity to change what he wannted to change ,why? because the school start to talk about this when he was in 12 grade and he did have change to think well,he didn't have chance to change his way of think ,another example I can give is that some students like latinos students , some of them doesn't have a good economical life and this may be hard forsome of them on finishing their career ,so they have to start getting credits ,start to get good grades to get a scholarship, Because most of the latinos students want to be successfull in their ife and this would work for them ,Identifying want students want for their future at a young age is good ,because they know what they really want and this really work

In conclusion ,Identifying a career at a young age is good because the students will have they time to know what they really want ,and to know on what they are good at,and start to do good at high school for they to graduated,the students will have more opportunities in their life is they choice a good career for their life , this is a plan that would change the way how students think;young students think better and very clear and this may guide them toward a specific career in their life.
