Failure is a simple thing that everyone use to get. some people are loss of enthusiasm but some people they do not by keep trying. In my mind I agree with " success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." this is very important thing that we might think about, The reason why I agree whit this statement be cause of failure brings me a improvement, success.

I always improve myslef when I get a failure. Last year, I was in high school in New York, it was my first year for studying in America. because it was my first time so I fail a tasting so many tests, I could not talked to any friends and I also could not made friends. everything were so hard for me to pass or event talking whit someone, so I keep continued stady more English skill. Right now a year pass, my English is batter than first time that I got here.

Failure make me stronger and bring me success. I got a lot of problems last year, so

I was thinking about go back to Thailand but I always tell myself "don't give up Generic_Name,you can try it again, you can do it, you will get it" and I believe myself. I did not go back to Thailand and I got a lot of new things make myself stronger.

the Failure is important role in life. We get success form leaening from our makestake, we improve everytime that we fail. If we give up and walk away from our failure,than we are just a losser.
