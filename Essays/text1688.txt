Former British Prime Minister Winston once said that "sucess consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiam and basically its asking me if i agree on it.

Basically i really have never heard about this prompt but i find it reallu intersting and would love to know more about it, I feel like if there were to ask me an a public place for example now but instead a public place and read about it more and even just reading a little bit about it makes me agree on it.

In my opinion i would definitly agree on it since what he said was pretty true, he basically said something that is basically true and not only that its basically making you think that it is right that "sucess consists on many thing but for sure loss of enthusiams"which is not wrong now i feel like ive thought about it just couple minutes and its making me think alot about it specially how much ive failed and life and always got up back like nothing was wrong.

May not be true for many people but for sure for me,I would agree on it 100% without doughting it at all , its always the ones that have failed and gotten up who would agree on it, it could be tuff for many to accept it but eventually they would agree to it if they were to think about how many times they have failed and won there battled with fighting for it and doing basically what they really want in their life. All you have to do to get through things are get stronger and work on yourself more, feel valued to your surroundings.

However, I have failed so many times and always thought about how i wouldnt make it not even how hard i try to i wasnt gonna make it out of the dark place i was in and eventually i told myself that it was very pointless of even trying anymore if all i was going to do is fail all over again , I didnt have no type of enthusiam whatsoever was horrible and all i did everyday was loss my enthusiam more and more until one day i got back up like a normal day and said to myself that "Life doesnt get easier you only have to get stronger' and i realized so much at that moment i wouldnt even believe myself that i was up like nothing and day ago i was not in the right mindset thinking i was a completely failure and even didnt have enthuasiam for nothing. so last i would agree to the saying of the Former British Prime Minister Winston it made me realize alot and a very true saying of course,
