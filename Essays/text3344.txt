I think what you can take summer school for to finished the school in three years is a good idea because you can leave to school in start working or doing other somethings how example you can get a good job and make good money or you can start work for to help in the hause like your mom, father, and making money for buy something for yourself like a car, clothes, and the another rason.

If the student have 17 or 18 years old he can leave the school and not when they have 22 years old like the hispanic because they coming with 15 or 16 years old and the school put they in grade nine and if you graduate in only three years is better for you, becuase they going to was 18 years old and they already for to work in learned more english but that not is the same case for American People.

With the work force for to finish the school in one year early, I think that is hard but is so good for students with 18,19,20 years old because they can finish early in lirobic time in one year.

If you're hispanic that's not better choice for you, because you can't learn more english and that's going to be hard for you when you start work, but that not is the samein the case with American People because the english not is a problem with they and if they have the same years old they can get a good job and leave the school in lirobic time.

That's what i think about the finish the school in three and not four years and the work force for to finish the school in one year early, If the school give me the oportunity choice I say ''I want to finish the school in three years'' because is better for me for my years old .
