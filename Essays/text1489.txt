I think some student take a class at home because they live to far or they not have any transportation however the students can study for video or for online, but I think that is not benefit because it most better to learn more going to the school, for example the teacher they wants to theirs students learned but something they can put a lot homework because they want to their students learned however some student they live to farm from the school but they take the bus or they take the train and another transportation because they want a do something on the future, but is not bad idea to the students take class on the home because everyone wants to do something on the future for example if you someone wants to do something on the future they need to going to the school or take class for online becuase the school very important however not everybody have the same opportunities.

But I think the online class is not benefit for the students because they can not learn better maybey the students they can not consentrate good at home becuase they distrate for something and they cannot learn about the lesson and maybe the teachers they cannot teach good however on the schools the students they cannot distrate and they put attention when the teachers theach the lesson better however they force the students to put attention because the teacher wants their students learned.

However some people they don't have the opportunities to going to schools but they pay a class for online maybe they work the all day and they wants to studies, for example, the hispanic people they work immigrant to this country but the work hard to pay the rent and other bills but some people they wants to learn English to have a better wrk so for the reason they pay for online class becuase thyey wants to learn other language or they wants to have a better job so for the reasons is benefit for they pay for online class however not everyone have the same oppotunities.

The school is very important but some students doest like the school and some students like the school becuase they want to do someone on the future so if the students wants to do something on the fututre they need to have a dreams because the person doest have a dreams they don due anything because we can take the opportunities to the parents give to their childrens becuase some childrens on the world they wants to have any opportunity.

But in my opinion some people is possible to take a class for online maybe is not possible to their going to schools but they can pay classes for online but is not the same like the schools but they can due if they have dreams they can due because everybody have dreams.
