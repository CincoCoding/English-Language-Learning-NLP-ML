Having a good attitude in a difficult time is a great way to stay calm and talk to others with respect. I witnessed one day a new kid came to my school with attitude he was giving out everyone what they want like many people asked him where he was coming from he said "I'm coming from

New York". He genially answer their question with respect and calmness like one kid asked how old are you, He replied saying that "I'm 14 years old" Even though

Some kids were being rude to him some of them even try to bully him,but cause of his attuide no one couldn't do much. He had no problem talking with teachers and other kids cause he wasn't feeling shy to talk with them he was happy and he was making an eye contact with everyone he's talking with. The kid probably had fun he made new friends earlier than other kids that were new. So that's why having a attitude not always means bad. So is your choice to be whatever you want how you wanna be treated because if you gonna treat others with bad attitude you should not expect them to treat you with respect. You can have a attitude and you still can be good is not always bad.
