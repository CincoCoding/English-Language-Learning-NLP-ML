To me its more beneficial working as a group. I have a few reasons why its better working with a group rather then working alone you can learn from one another also be motivated to learn as a group. Making new friends can be tough but when you are but in a group you can make friends with each other. One thing in a group that can be good and bad is having disscustions with the group. There are many reasons why i prefer working with a group and im hear to share with you.

Working with a group is all about sharing new ideas and discovery with your group that some people didn't know about. With a group everyone would get good grades and ace their exams. Some people in your group may have the same intrest as you and would like to study that objective more and being motivated by one another.

In my opinion working with a group is more simpler and fun at the same time and kids will enojy learning that way.

One small little problem about working with a group is having disscustions about the subject that the group is talking about. They with all disagreements but also argree with each other . The group tends to get mad maybe because someone in the group said something the other didn't like and would have a argument. There are more pros then cons in working with a group for sure .

Everyone has a different saying if its beneficial to either work with a group or work alone .

I'm not at all saying working alone is a bad thing on the contrarie its also good because sometimes you might not get along with the group you got asand with and you just wanna do your work alone. Working in a group though brings you toghter as a school and theres nothing better then working in a team.
