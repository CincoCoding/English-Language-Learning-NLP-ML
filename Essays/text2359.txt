I think this pogram should be in every school beacuse this could help the younger students to learn more about the school. And the older students can the younger students and they can show them which room they have to go. And its better this way beacuse the older students knows more things about the school then the younger students do. And this could help the younger students learn more about the school. This will make the students feel about their seld beacuse they were helping other younger students. Now the srudents feel more comfortable beacuse they got helped from the other students from the other students so now the younger students feel way happier beacuse they know where to go. And if this was not a thing students will be all sad and fustrated beacuse they will be all lost beacuse they new to the school and wont have no one to help them. The younger students going to be really sad beacuse they wouldnt know what to do and what class they have to go. So this a reason of why every older students should help new kids at the school or any younger students. And the younger students gonna learn from the older students and this pogram can help the younger students get their grades up beacuse older students can help them do they work and get their grades up
