Where would i want to go vist? i would want to go to vist el salvador because i want to go vist my famliy. Also i would want to go the beach . Then i would love to eat their food that they have

My one reason i want to go to el salvador ,i want to go vist my famliy because i have not seen them in 6 years and i really want to spend time with them. Also i would want to spend with my baby cousin. the reason i would spend time with him is because he's a very special kid and he's very sick i would do many things for him. After i spend time with him i would take my famliy for dinner and they would be happy that i took them out to eat.

My second reason is i would want to go to the beach because i want to see how beutiful it is over there. Also many people say it's beutiful because of the ocean. Then i would want to go to swim! Many people say that the water is very warm because it's closer to the equitor, it's not like the US the water is cold. Then after swiming i want to buy a neckless for everyone in my famliy.

My third reason is i would want to try their food that they have because people say it's amizing. I want to try their poposa because it's better then the stores. The way you they make it,is they start with corn masa, then they make a mini bowl , then you can put cheese and beans whatever you want, then you close it you put it in the pan and let it cook. The best thing about poposa when they're over fill when the cheese and beans are dripping.

These are my reason where would i go to vist. we should vist many place because we can learn somthing new. Also we should try are best to go somewhere at least the cheaps trip you can find. maybe i would be able to go to el salvador.
