The first impresions is when you current know at someone or something. It is the first opinion that you mind create, but this impresions or idea can change when you start to know better.

The change can affect or can benefit, that means that sometimes we thinks that is good and bad, thinks that is bad and is good. A example of affect is when we buy a car, and these is look like beautiful for autside, but when a mechanical check inside descover that have many damage. A example of benefit is when somebody told you something bad of other person, and when you talk with that person you descover that is false.

The first impresions can change for many reasons that our mind create; for example, false opinion, dissapointment, angry, or autocorrection. All these can have influence when you change your impresions of someone or something. For example, when we are angry all is look like bad or annoying. Other example, when we make a autocorrection of something that we believed that was bad or incorrect.
