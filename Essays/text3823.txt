My father, and I have a dialogue one saturday night, at the dining table he ask me what i want to become when i grow up, and

I reply i don't know he watch me and laugh you need; to discover your career now so you will get prepare for the future I said ok.

The issue is discovering your passion or career earlier can help you to discover and prepare for you goals in the future early.

I agree it is a good idea for student to commit their career because know or understand what you want to do in the first place can help you to discover what and what you good at or bad at and what you need to pay more atention on like for example you wanted to become an engineer you need to pay more atention on maths and science and now all your focus will be on that.

FIRSTLY

Know and understand what you want to be in life can bring you much more closer to your goal like understanding the question is part of the answer so understanding or discover your career can be a helpful thing towards your future for example: I want to be a teacher but i didnot know that i can't speak a good english and i don't now how to explain so that my student can understand me but i never knew about this until now and it too late for me to go back and discover a new career because am half away to graduate from high school.

SECONDLY

You can't do what they like but you can do what you like your passion can't be stop even by yourself not talking about other your love and determination can make you do it but that will only happen if you discover your career early and prepare for it for example: My passion for become an auto engineering increase every single day i just can't wait to be one because since when i was in middle school have discover my career my dream and i know i have passion for it have prepared and determine myself for it

THIRDLY

After high school it will be too late for you to think about your career and what you want to become in future and beside in high school they prepare you and guide you towards your specific career and you not yet discover your career it will be a tough one for you out there example you don't like anything or you don't know what to do after high school and graduate without knowing what you gonna do out there your life will be at risk it just like you in a sea with a speed boat but you don't know how to ride it with a opportunity but you don't know how to used it

My Conclusion is know what you want to do because life is about time and when you discover your career earlier you will have more time to prepare and determine yourself if you really ready for it before is too late your career should discover earlier it can be helpful for student in future.
