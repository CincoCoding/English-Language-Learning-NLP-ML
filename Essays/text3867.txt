Should you relied on yourself or other about life's important matters?

Its important that people relied on their own instincts and ideas because if we have people picking chooses for others we would have no power on what we want, for example people who learn from them self are more active and confidant then the ones that have to learn from other, and wait for instructions. I belieave that people should relied on them selfs for two reasons. My first reason is that every one makes mistakes, and thats were we learn to not do them again. Infact when you make mistakes is better because you get to try again and you get to do it even better, there for to succesed in life you will have to fall, and get back up in to your feet to try again and do it better. My second reason is that if you let others choose for you, you will never learn to deal with hard thinking situations. Also you get to learn more about your self and you get to do stuff your own way and you also learn to love your self from your mistakes. I think that every person should make there own choose when it comes to hard momemts like when my grandma die my parent pick what we was going to do with her, and she didnt go ask some one what to do, no she knew what to do from expiriens of my grate grandma, and thats why some problems have to be dealt by your self. In conclusion its important that people learn to think and do things own there own so they wont spend money on others telling them what to do, and also not relied on somes help from others, some chooses are hard and some are easy but every choose you make, makes you up and shows who you really are.
