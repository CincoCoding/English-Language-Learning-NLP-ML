Changing our school meun to much healthier choice's is a good idea because its good for the students to eat much healthier food in school. Eating more fresh fruits and water can help students focus and not fall asleep in class. Eating junk food could make you tired and you won't have theenergy to do anything. Its better to take away the opition of getting junk food that the cafeteria puts out for students. Students wont be so tempted to eat it, and could chose a better and healthier choice.

Most students want to stay in shape, so they try to eat healthier. adding more healthier choices in th school caferteria meun could help them stay in shape. most students don't workout so they depend on the food they eat. Some students tend to buy food and then throw it out becuase of how the food is made. The school could make a slald bar for those who chose to eat it and they could add there own toppings so they could eat somthing they like instead of throwing it out.

I think having fruits smoothies, organic bake goods, and a salad bar could be very good for every school to have because the school could make a lot of money selling this at school and its healthy for students to eat and enjoy. most students wont have to get uber eats to get food that they like if the school sold smoothies or bake goods. And staff members that get lunch from the cafeteria could enjoy having a healthier lunch.

in conclusion changing the schools cafeterias meun to much healthier choice would be good for students and staff members so they could stay healthy and focus.
