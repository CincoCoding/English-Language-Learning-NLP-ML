societies decide student at the young age are expected to decide what collage or univercity they want and what carrer they should be going to chose. students in freshman year cannot decide what they want to study or what collage they want to go ,because their too young to make that important decition even if they make it , when the years passed they are going to study another carrer, anoher one that gives then inspiration

.student should not commit in a carrer with young age,they can make a bad decition, if they have another oportunity to change their decition it can be good but if they can't it can be bad if you get in a carrer that your are not going to improve.

students who enter to HS for the first time they should focus on get classes for example: art, economy, guitar, etc. Another responsability that the student shoud focus is in get credits for dipoma that they want that can be standard or advanced diploma another think they must focus is get good grade for all four years nine, ten, eleven, and the most important 12 but when the student get into the eleven grade they must being thinking about what they want to study, searching for collage and carrers, get imformation about collage and universities that can be good for you. when they get a good noulesh ,they can ask than self, its that what they want to study and don't led anyone make a decition for you,think about a carrer that can like you and benefit you in the future something that like you and never is going to get tired of your carrer because you like what you chose for your and you have a pasion on your carrer that why society have to change that expectation that the students have to make a desiton in young age,choosing a carrer is not a game its imortant to contrivuted with the society in life if you choos a carrer that you are not going to improve is going to be dificult cause yo have make a wrong decition

Teachers in higt school shuld provide a good ideas for student talks about, how the collage or the univercity it can be teach them how is the way the collage and univercities work with the students. However, when the students are youngest they cannot decide what they want to study, firts they want be a doctor and the a few years later a police and thats how it goes youngest student can't decide what they want to be until they get to a good age and a good inspiration on a class and that helps them to decide what carrer they want,student should focus on the carrer they want baced in what class are they very good when you are in eleven garde you see that your are good in something, you don't have to chose a carrer that you don't understand or you don't like. schools shuold focus on what the student want to be in the future but they can focus to in what are they good for example: they can see if the student if good painting it can be a painter or if the are good in number it can be good in bussines such as banks , cashier and they can improve all this nuolage in the job that the students has as a part-time ,thats what the schools should focus in what the students are good and then make a decition of what can study and what it can be a good collage or univercity for each one .

societies should not expect that students with young age should decide to chose what to study (a carrer) they don't have clare ideas to decide what they want to syudy. However, many student that make a decition in young age they can decide but in a few month they are going to chose another carrer because they don't like what they decide or they don't have the noulage, that why youngets students cannot make a important decition until they get in a good noulage.
