I agree with Ralph waldo when he said's "to be your self in a world that trying constantantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishments."

although being yourself is a very hard thing to do especially when you have nobody buy your side though it all at first it seems easy but once you try so hard to make people proud you would wanna feel like fiting in.

But yet again here we are learning from our own mistakes why try to make our self just what others want us to be, why cant we just be us for just simply pleasing ourselves I wish we woulden't care what people think about us but do , but we have to face reality sadly weather we like it or not theres no alternatives.

Because whats the point?, just to be something we are not, for example one we would be lying to ourselves and second either way no matter how much we try its never enough for anyone because at the end of the day how we choose to be either our self or not nobody will ever be pleased with our decisions not the other way around.

Sometimes our influences may proswade us and to a sertin point we try so hard not to fit in but the people that we hang around the most we reflect upon them even if we see it or dont at the end of they day they try but the real question is do they succeed? yes but only temporary nothing lasts forever everything has its timing when it should or wont come to our lives.

I mostdefinlty agree to being yourself is a huge accomplishment, but we might not understand at the moment, how or why but we will soon rather then later at first its complicated even difficult although its just tempawarly things that accur in that priest moment it can also be for our great or good but we should've been proud of what diden't thad happen.

So i believe sticking with yourself is always the best policy dont worry what people say about you, you know where you stand dont let anyone tell you so plus being yourself will mark the difference in you people cant always tell what you are they dont define you thats for you to decide not them,So dont be embarrassed of yourself show yourself off believe in yourself because your limit is and only you.

Thank you for your time hope to hear from you very soon.
