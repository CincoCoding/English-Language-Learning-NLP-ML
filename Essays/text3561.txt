Present. A lot people have a busy life and work hard. Because every one need to have a happy life. A lot people have a happy life just because they have to do something they like. But lot people believe happy is come from money and work hard to get it. But most of them not happy. Because they just work for money not for happy.

But when she working almost 2 years she so tired every day and she begin don't want to work.

She can sell some flower and get some money. And then 1 year has past. she don't work in the TOYOTA company anymore. She choose to spend time for flower farm. She like this work and she so happy.

The life is short. Everyone have only one life. You should spend you time for something you like to do. It doesn't matter you have a good income or not. To be yourself. You might think the rich people is happy. But rich people happy not because they have money but because they have time to do anything they like.
