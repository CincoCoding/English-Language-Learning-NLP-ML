I agree honesty is the best policy but sometimes honesty is bad beacuse you can hurt people feeling and people dont fell the same with you when your hones with them. Also someone that like when people are honesty with them they wont care because it good to be honesty with them beacuse what if there doing something bad that you dont like and your hones with them and you tell to fix that thing that where doing that you dont like. Another thing if you get in trouble in school be hones with your teacher and tell them what happened be hones dont ever lie to your teacher. Then if your in a relationship with some and you dont like them anymore dont be shy then the true be hones. finally if you go to a store and you tell something from the store and they tell you are you stealing something tell them the true beacuse if you leave with out paying you can get in trouble with the police that why be hones with some ask you if your stealing something tell them then true be hones. That why i agree with honesty.
