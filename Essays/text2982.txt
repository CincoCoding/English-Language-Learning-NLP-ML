Many people like to like to record data, so they might really enjoy a experiment. For example, in a experiment that a person has to measured and put the data in a table. Some people would fight for this task, that is how much a person love recording data. There might not be author person to fight for it but there is always going to be a person that wants yo do it. Experiments might be enjoyable to some people that like recording data. Some people might be in a math class recording data, but I think a experiment is more affected.

This is one reason why I think experiments are a enjoyable activity.

In the other hand, some people like to find out how something works. For example, a person might want to find out how the Faces of Matter changes. Maybe that person already knows, but want to know more about it. Therefore, that person does a experiment to find out more. Some people love to learn different things. other people will spend all their life trying to fine something out. It maybe new or not.

This why I think a experiment is a enjoyable activity.

Recording data and finding our how something works are just two reason why experiment is a enjoyable activity. People will fight just to record data. Other people will spend all their life doing experiment just to fine something out. This are the reasons I think a experiment is a educational and enjoyable activity.
