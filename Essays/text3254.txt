some people believe that true self esteem com from achievement, I

think that they are wroung, i think that self esteem come from praising student.

people that believe that true self esteem come from praissing student work are think that they are right.

like for example;

if the student want to learn and and they are trying to do what you ask that to do and they died not do it the right way and you tell than that is not bad and you keep encorraging than to keep trying, it will give than the cinfident to do more work because they know that they are doing something good,

but if they are workung hard and you keep telling than that they are dum or telling than that they are not doing it the right way they will get tire and will not have the energy to work anymore.

people that prais student are people who want to show the student that they can do any thing that they want to do in life, I belive that many student will be able to do well in school if only the teachre can make than to know that they are spical like every one of the student in the class or school, there are many student out there that want to learn but they just need someone who will be able to encorrage than that they should trust in that self and tell than that they can do it.
