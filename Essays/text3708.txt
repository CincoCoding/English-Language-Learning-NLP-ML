Imagine having a secret talent. Talking or singing with my mouth close is a talent, because it makes people happy and it also helps me feel less nervous.

It makes people feel happy because, one day kids were playing outside I decided to tell them funny jokes with my mouth close. The kids felt happy and were wondering how to talk without moving your mouth. Sometimes I tell my friends that I like their smile with my mouth close. It makes them smile more because they know its me. Having a talent can make people happy and you can also make their day.

It also helps me feel less nervous and helps me talk to people alot with my mouth close. One example is that when I sing I get really nervous so just sing with my mouth close and nobody looks at me because I am not moving my mouth. Singing with my mouth close makes me feel confident. When I am walking and people are asking for dirrections I get to do it with my mouth close. Talking with my mouth close helps me a lot when I dont want to talk or when I am having a bad really bad day. Sometimes is hard to communicate and it is hard not to be nervous so talking and singing with my mouth helps me a lot.

Eveyone has a talent. Singing with your mouth close or talking is a talent because it makes you feel happy and sometimes it helps when you are nervous. You can make people happy when you have a talent. It also helps you to be more confident with yourself. You also get to share with the world what you are able to do. I think that sometimes when you have a talent can help people and can make everyone else happy.
