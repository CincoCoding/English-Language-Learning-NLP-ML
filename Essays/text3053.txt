The benefits to working in group or working along.

The benefits to working in group are the we can't share information with other's to help amswer the problems the we working in and if i working alone i has to put my on ideas. My tree reasons to working in group are we will working all together, we get more support of the other people that are in my group and my last reason are the i will feel more relax and the tree reason that a think if i will working alone are the i has to support my ideas by my self, and if i get confuse nobaby can't help me, and my last reason are the i will feel more frustrartion to finish the work or if the idea the i put are not good. The benefit that i think can't help the student more are to work in group because we can't support other.

My first reason about working in group are the we work together and can't be more easy to finish the work in time to learn how work in group we will share some information to my group and all people that are in my group has to share some imformation i will feel more motivation to other's.

My second reason that i put the we can get more support because if we work in group we can't help each other's we lear to work in group that why a like more to working in group because some time if someone no know the answer we can't help hi or her to answer the question.

my last reason that i put in my essay are the we feel more relax because we can't not get frustrartion because the other's people that are in my group can't help us if sometime we can't get confuse to some preoblems they can't give us support to answer the problems .

That are my tree easons that why i likes to working in group that why i don't likes to work alone because some time can be more frustrartion to us and sometime we can't get more homewoork we can't give and get support because we work in to a group i think that is more easy to work in group because we can't support that ideas and we check if that ideas is good and not and coul be lest work to the other's because we can't share like one person do something and the other's person another thing about work that can't work .
