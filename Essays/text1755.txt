First impressions is what I learn from many people. People have many impressions and yes it is hard to change.

Impressions are special to some people but it also could effect people in certain ways. Ways where your whole behavior might change or attitude or maybe your whole person. When we first meet people we see their first impressions and we see on how they are or we check on how their behavior is. We all have a instict on where we look at some people and judge but we also see the attitude in the people. First impressions are special sometimes because you dont know who you are going to meet next and on how they are good or if they have some bad in them.

Everybody is unique in many different ways. People do say that first impressions is impossible to change. I think it's impossible becuase people are very different everybody is different and sometimes we just have to accept it.

Some people don't understand that some people can't change even if its for the better or the worse some people will just always be the same. Impressions are something you can't change from people.
