I agree with Bristish Prime Misnister Winston Churchill. The failure comes before of success So, I think that everybody had a failure in their lives but I think that is good because we are learning about our failure and I think that the failure is important becuse with the our failures we can be a better people for the socity or community. I think like Generic_Name goes to university and fail science class, Generic_Name had a failure but he can think about it what happen or that is wrong in science class and then, Generic_Name study a lot for recover science class. the final of semester Generic_Name recover science class, Generic_Name had a success because Generic_Name study a lot to recover science class and Generic_Name doesn't loss the hope to recover science class. So I think that the success is good for us because the success make us better. I believe that my failure that I had before that help me to be a better person to learn more to do thinks that I don't believe that i can do and the thing that a have is thanks of my success that I had it. I think if you have a lot success it is because you are donig well. If you have mistake in your life just learn about it because that help you to don't do it agian the same mistake. My concluison is The life is amazing and maybe in the future we can have fails or we can have success but the most important is that you learn abour yours mistake and yours failure because that helps you to be a better person in the community and the socity and in your life.
