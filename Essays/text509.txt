Agree with author Ralph Woldo Emerson wrote bucause to be yourself is the you make special for another people in the world you thinking different for another people you have different feeling you make something else and the world you meet another people

,is you the same another people you know is the same of you this is make the world to be boring, all the people to be the same you not who you are because all the people is the same all the people make the samething.

If you not to be yourself copy or the same people, you never find feeling or reasons and your life you make something you not like , for example you are not the same another person you have different goal, feeling, something you like and you personality,and not to be interesting becasue all the people is the same, and however you have two face you due something you never meet your real face.

conclucion:Always to be yourself in the world use your face real you are special for all the world is you to be yourself you make a different the world,you due wherever you want complete your goal your dream because you change tha world if you to be yourself.
