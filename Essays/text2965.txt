Why should students have a good attitude even when they're not in the mood? I think that students should have a positive attitude because. it might make them forget why they were even upset in the first place. They can also brighten someones day by giving them a compliment or just as little as smiling at someone.

Also if you have a positive attitude you can accomplish your goals. Therefore if you have a positive mindset not only can you achieve and accomplish your goals. You can be proud of who you have become and your hard work. Once youv'e done everything you dreamt of achieving. Your parents would be so proud. Having a positive mindset encourages young children to treat everyone with respect. And children could learn from the elderly and mimick their actions and words.

In conclusion i believe that everyone should treat everyone with respect and have a good attitude towards one another because were all one. Regardless of race and religion.
