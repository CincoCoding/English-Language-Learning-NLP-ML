The school cafeteri should change the food to healthier food. they should not give to the student everyday chess pizza, MC checken and rich, beacuse those food are not healty, and Thoes food are not good for student health. the school cafeteri should give to the student vigetable food beens, fruite, mcgrni, fish, and the food that dose't have oil in it , beacuse if the school cafeteri keep giving the same food to the student, they will not take those food beacuse they ate everyday the same food and the student will not take the lunch, and then the school have to throw those food in trush beacuse the student do not buy those food.

and the school will not make any provite from those food the school will lose a lot of money. So I ruquset to the principal to bring those change to school cafeteri, so you can make money and the student will be also happy from school cafeteri and they will buy the lunch.

Thank you
