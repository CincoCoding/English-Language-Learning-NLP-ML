I feel like best way is working with a group is great idea because you have the chances to meet new people you dont know and have little convestions with them while working on getting ideas and finding the right respone for your work on what the teacher gave as a group. Well one good reason on why working with a group is a good idea my opionion is because by working in a group you can find different details on what the teacher given what to work on in a group yall can bring up all the information yall came with or got from the internt and have argument about which one should be the best answer. Another reason on why is a good idea working with in a group it's a easy way to get a better garde as a group and working in a group is really fun you get to talk and use the computer sometimes the teachers let us use our phone and we make like a little group chat for us to talk about the work she told us to do and share our answers on the group chat and see who agree with it or who don't and we all got different reasons and at the end of the day we pick the support detail and use it. My benefits of working with a group is that if you are one of them students who really want to be in a group and help people and on there work show them how smart your are and that you in the group of people you are a hard worker.
