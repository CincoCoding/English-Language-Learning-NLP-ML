I would want to go to France, Generic_City i would want to go see culture. What food's are there,what they eat the most what do they like. I would want to go see the famous team Generic_City saint germin. Also what type of activates they like doing there. When I first get there i'm going to look and walk around the cities and town's and see how it really is and i'm going to explore the Eiffel tower and i'm go to see what everyone does. Next I got to see what type of religion there is. I wanna know what type of holiday there is and not .

Then i got to see how people act if they nice or not? i'm gonna try to go see a Generic_City saint germin game. I would go meet nice people then i would try to talk to then and now iv'e gotten a little better with my French since now i got French. and iv'e worked hard to speak french. So i bet that i could talk to some people in French. I would to to eat because people usually talk good stuff about there food so i would like to try.

Then I would go to buy stuff like the type of clothes they wear to fit in with everybody. I would go see what type of places there are like if there were like a little town I could be different to the big places in France. I would got church for a day and see what type of religion and what they do for religion. I would check if i would even live there but I still would'ent know because I havent gone yet. but i still bet I would be a wonderful place to go one day

I would also try going because to observe and try learning the language because next if I go i'm going to speck fluently. i would problobly go to school there for an education and learn other different languages because they learn two more languages than us. I could even listento there music because its good. its always better going to new places. A lot of people have said its oneof the nicest places to go. So i might go one day and I might take my fmaily becuase its a pretty friendly place i bet.
