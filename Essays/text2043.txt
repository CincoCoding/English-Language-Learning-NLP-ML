Based on my experieneces, do I agree or disagree with Emerson's statement. I do agree on what Ralph Waldo statement said,"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." You should always push yourself to the max on everything you do. Try finding a better and faster way to solve what you already mastered. Work even harder then you worked before. Also try something more harder than the previous thing you did. For example Lebron James, he wasn't rich or wealth when he was little, he had to work hard to get where he is now. Lebron trained everyday to get better, stronger, and put his best on the basketball court so he can stand out from the rest. Even today Lebron James is training to be come the best NBA player ever and works really hard to beat/break other famous NBA players records. Each NBA superstars have different stories to tell on how they got there. Not only just NBA players work hard, other people around the world has stories to tell on how they never stopped working harder than before to grow. .These are the reasons and examples on why I do agree with Raplh Waldo statement.
