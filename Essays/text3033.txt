Reasons why the school board not add one hour and a half more for each day. i have a few reasons why we shouldn't do that. first reason homework. Second reason the time after school and third reason why is teachers. these are going to be my reason why in this passage.

First reason is homework if we have more time in the school day how would students have time to do their homework. If we had a hour and a half more then teachers shouldn't give homework to students. students shouldn't have more time in school then have homework after school students have have some time to enjoy themselves and still do homework if we have more hours in school students wouldn't have the time to enjoy themselves. If students did their homework after they wouldn't have time to enjoy themselves after because it would be dark outside then they have to go to bed.

Second reason is students having time like i said in the other paragraph students wouldn't have time if we had more hours in school. students wouldn;t do fun after homework after school because by the time you know the sun would go down and it would be too late for anything. go out somewhere, play outside, and hang with friends.

Third reason why is because teachers. teachers would have more work in their hands teachers have a life too they need to get to their families too. and all the work they have to do would them holding longer which would keep longer away from their families too this is is why schools shouldn't have more hours in school
