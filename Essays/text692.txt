A enjoyable educational activity is when I was doing a science experiment wewas building a volcano. It irupted we was all smiling because we didnt know it was gonna work. we put soda inside the volcanoe and we shaked it a little and then put mentos it went high. we had to clean it up after there was a mess every where but it was fun. As soon as everybody left I was taking to the teacher to ask her wat I got.

He told me that I got a B and I got mad because I got a B I was all like how and he told me that there was soda every where. it was messy and it had mentos in it and I was like please give me an A or can i at least remake it. He was like you can have one more chance to remake it I was all like thank you. it took me a while to make it and think what I can do so it wont spill anywhere. So I thought of putting a cone around the volcano put I was all like nah because whats the whole point of putting it if you cant see it.

I got an idea I put a lighter in side and a put a special paint that blows up with just fire. it can not make a mess I dont have to clean the floor I think this the best idea. i did it and i tryed it out at my house and it always blew up every where and I kept on thinking and thinking but I had no idea Ithought that it had to much paint and iI kep on putting it little by little.

It kinda worked if I put a little in a bootle and light it like that but thene I had an idea that if a put newspaper under it and let it burn it will help it and it did and then i kept putting more and more news paper it took like 16 news of paper and my brother helped me do it it was hard because i didnt know which way to put it. I got it all finished and I took it to school.

It was my turn i represented the volcano I lit it on fire and the whole volcano fell and I was mad. after school the teacher called me and told me.''you did a great job but it failed but guess what you get an A for at least trying'' I was so happy I didnt belive it I did it.
