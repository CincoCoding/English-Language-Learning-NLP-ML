The author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote," To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

Imagine in a world that is trying to change you in everyway.

I'm disagree because you have right to do what you want to do with your life or who you want to be in your life and nobody have to say what you need to do. Example; all people in this world have rights, bacause alot people trying to change your life, and they want you to do what they said, if you think you are right do not lessent to the people.

To many time the comunity try to change your descision and they do not respect what you said. that's why is alot problem in the poblation. Example; to much politician people want to change customs and religions they can't do anything about it, because that is a decision from there culture.

If you took a decision about to put your own company and your friends say you can not do that, just try to do your best and don't peatention to him. Example; in a company every employer have his own rights like what time they need to be there or what time they get out the work.

The reason why i shoose disagree is because to many people in this world do not respect when you make your own decision, if you can do something do not worry about what people say. The solution to this problem is do what you thing is right; and the comunty need to have a good relationship families,neightborhood, and students.
