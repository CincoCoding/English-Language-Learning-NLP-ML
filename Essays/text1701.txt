I chose the lesson math for elementary school because. It can help out a lot,it makes number more easier when going on to middle school,it can make your intelligent bigger. When knowing your numbers or knowing how to do math it makes math seem really easy. When moving on later in life you dont have to keep on struggling because you will already know how to overcome prices because you been practicing math all your life. It pays off if you keep on doing math and practicing it over and over. When moving on to middle school or high school you have to already know your steps math setups or your going to have a hard time in middle school and high school. Plus you will have good grades in math all the time and your test score will be good as well. I will always do math because i know later in life math will be every where you go and plus learning this in a young age will help you out a lot and it make a really smart person If you really keep on. Math will be every where you go and sometimes you have to do math when your in the store, gas station, when your buying stuff online,

even when your buying a gift for someone. Learning how to do math will help out a lot. I know sometimes it will get boring or you will get bored of it but just knowing how to do math it will help you and save your life in college. Because in college your going to see some pretty big numbers and math problems. Math will be important in so many ways because in life your going to use a lot of math so its better learning it when your young. So then you dont have to worry about it so much later on in life. This is why math is an important lesson for elementary students.
