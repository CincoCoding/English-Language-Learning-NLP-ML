"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to Chang" i agree with this quot, for three reasons.

First, when you meet someone and you see how they act you get those feelings about them if it was hate or love. Second, you may never meet that person agean, so the way he act this one time is gong to make you judge them. Third, or even if you see them every day the way they act toured you give you thats feelings that never will Chang toured them or your impressions. Finally,that why you cant Chang your first impressions.

Those feelings that you get turd that person, if it was love or hate is because of the way they act.

For example this one time i met someone and it was my first time meeting him so i did not know what to expect from him. After talking to him i did not like the way he talk or his personality so my impressions for him was not good and i never Chang the idea that i took of him. I never met that person aegean in my life. Thats why when you take that look at someone you never chang your mind.

changing how people think is hared
