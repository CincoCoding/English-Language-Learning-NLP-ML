Do we accomplish always doing something, that quastion can be answerd in different ways on the tipe of person that you ask; theres people that are accomplished with what they do, but theres people that not like to do their stuff because maybe they do not like to do what they are doing, or its hard to do it or they are just tired of it. For people that like to do what they do they have some stuff that make them feel acomplishwith what they do for example:

The space are were they work at.

The relation ship that they have with other workers to work together .

How hard is the job that they are doing that makes them feel comfrontable.

In the other heand the people that do not like what they do, they don't feel accomplish for this reasons for examole:

The work area is not comfortable to them.

The people do nt have a good relation ship with the workers.

The work is to hard since no one likes to help echader.

In my way of think I would pick that i feel accomplish with what I'm doing because maybe is hard or I dont feel comfrontable odoing it, but I enjoi doing it is something that i considere accomplihsment for; Im the one who is doing it that nothing is going to change it and Thomas Jefferson was right it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing it.

My conclution is that if we have to enjoy what we are doing even if is something that we dont like to do, or is just a person that you are working with is not good enght to work with , but it doen's not matter about what you do your idias that you have made the work that they did and the prgres that could be helpfull to expire you to do more thing to feel accomplished with your self.
