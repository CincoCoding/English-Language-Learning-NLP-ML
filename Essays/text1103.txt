I understand what are you tying to say about determine never to be idle which means not working or being use to not be idle you must to do something everyday to change you're life, and accomplish you're goals, which is I agree with for two reasons.

one is if you have a goals trough the year something that you want to accomplish or you have a dream you must start to take a step by step reviewing it every single day saying to your'e self I can do it even though when no body see you're work no matter how long it will take , but eventually you will get to that point where you want to be as long as you tying you're best every day, and you will be successful in life.

A lot of people want to accomplish their goals, but the thing is they don't actually take action why because they afraid of fielder you can always win, but you can be the best as you could be, and you never be same again because you come this way if you don't do something every day you're life will never change.

Therefore, I strongly believe that if you are doing something everyday you will see the result at the end. you're life will change, and you will accomplish you're goals. I fully support, and respect you're words, which is I agree with.

Thank you for you're consideration.
