The pyramids are very huge. There are like 3 big pyramids and there like 6 other pyramids aren't that big as the first 3 pyramids. Pyramids are so hard to build to make them again. The pyramids need a lot of stone and it need some are like very big stones that are located in the very bottom of the pyramids,and it's hard to reach the max high of the pyramids because they are so high up. These pyramids are from the 7 fantastic and amazing things in the world because no body on this earth now can build these pyramids. The people who built the pyramids called the Pharana.
