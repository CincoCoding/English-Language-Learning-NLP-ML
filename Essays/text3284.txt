Dear: principal

I think that the policy is unfair because not all the students have a B range and they want to be in a sport team or other thing.

I why don't you change the policy to C' s. If not the team' s are not going to be complete and the school could lose all the games. Many students might change schools because they want to be in a team. sport's teach diciplean and team work witch will help in their future live when they grow up. when they get a jod were they have to do team work it won't be so hard because they already now how to communicate and show team work.
