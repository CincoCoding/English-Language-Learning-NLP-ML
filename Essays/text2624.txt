Yes. I agree with Ralph Waldo statement becuase it is true you got to farther than what you already know if u wantto succed in life you got to go farther then what you feel capable of doing life for example: i have a frienmd who plays soccer he used to stay playing difence i was like yo Generic_Name u should trry out on playing forward, he was like i don't know i have never played forward only defence, so i was like life is not about staying in one place life is all about going out there and do things you feel like you can't because u cant stay in one flace for the rest of your life; and know hes one of the best forward players my school have, life is not about just doing things u can life is all about experimenting new things to do something out of your limits to see what else are you good at because its a good feeling when you find out of what you capable of.

When you go out of your limits, you can find out lot of things about your self you get to know who the real you is, you get to know how inteligent, how brilliant you is to do things out of your rutin of every day we only live life ones but we live every day with out knowing if we going to wake up the next day, on my opinion i do agree with Ralph Waldo on his statement.
