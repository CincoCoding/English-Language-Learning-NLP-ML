They shouldn't extend the school day two hours , because every student have a schedule they run everyday like going to work , playing a sport , or any a school club they are in. The student would like a four day school week but they don't want a extra two hour in school this is a disadvantages if they was considering doing a four day school and only get a few hours to them self and going to school really early. The good benefits of it is that the student gets to have a three day weekend for the whole school year and more time to finish there homework or the work they missing to catch up with there grade for that class. The other disadvantages is if those other two was added the student is not going to pay attention and lose there focus on the lesson also there work or fall asleep in class. If i went to a school that had extra two hours I probable not pay any attention to my teacher or lose my focus and go to sleep till school finish. A other good benefit is that they can shorty the school year and make the holidays week longer or spring break longer. Those are same of good and bad reason toward this topic about having a four day school week i think it could be a some what a great idea so they can have a extra day to relax. Overall this is my opinion and thoughts for having a four day school week.
