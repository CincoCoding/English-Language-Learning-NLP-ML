Some people think that is a good idea, but actually it is not. I think we shoul keep folllowing the plan thatbis already planted by the goverment.

The reason are so many and complicated to explain right now, that is why I am only gonna explain and give example to three of those reason. One of them are that students should not go to college at very early age or go to the minlatary at very early age, Because of the their are not older anough and are not anough responsible handle to much presur in college and in high school, and most ot the time they don't really know what they want to be when grow up, and the course during summer and evenings are not much presur for the students.

They don't have the experience about what is life look like and how harts it is. They would not have any freedom duirng their all life if they follow that plan, because they always will be "between four walls", that's not the life that people want and that's not the sad path that parents want for the children I guess and I hope, but you never now what parents want and never ask what you want, and is another presur on their shoulders.

The elective courses are a way to expriment other classes and learn something else that students really want to do or maybe would like to do, I admint that students will learn the necessary, but not what they want, their will be sad if they never had a freedom to do what they want to.

In my conclusion: it's better to take things with calm and peace, not to take it to fast, we still have bunch of time to decide what's really matter and what's matter to us.
