is setting an good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people or are there better ways too influence others my opinion is that setting a good example can influence other people around you why because if they see you do something good they might catch on and say oh since he was being nice im start doing the same thing and start doing good deeds and that will help others because than people will start catching on and start being to nice to everyone. your setting example for the younger kids because most of the kids look up to there older siblings saying when i grow up i want to be like them so setting an example for the youth or anybody is great. it also helps with safety too if there was something going down like a robbery or a shooting adults will probaly try yo protect the younger kids and than when some adults see some kids by themeselves they will see other adults and run to protect more kids. and if your in school and you went to class and show up on time teachers can use you as an example for coming in on time being ready to do your work and people will look up tp that and say i want my teacher to use me as an example and start doing the same thing they'll be on time and ready to do there work.
