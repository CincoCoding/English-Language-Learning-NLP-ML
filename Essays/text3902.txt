I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to success because in life no matter what you do you need a positive attitude. for example when you go for a job interview you go into the place with a positive attitude of you wont get the job. its like getting a job you have to have a positive attitude when your working with your others or with customers. i think that in life everyone needs a positive attitude to accomplish there goals. I think that people that doesnt have a positive attitude wont get very far in life. because when i was in middle school i never had a positive attitude and i would get into a lot of trouble because of my attitude, and now that my attitude has changed im becoming successful in life. i think that in everything you do in life requires a positive attitude. you need a positive attitude when your talking to people. if you have a negative attitude people wouldnt want to be bothered by you because people dont like to be around people with a negative attitude. for example when you have a positive attitude people would like to be around you then to be around someone with a negative attitude.

being positive is the key to success because if your being negative your not going to be successful in life.
