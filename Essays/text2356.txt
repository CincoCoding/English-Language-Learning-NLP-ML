Dear, Principal

These kids should be allowed to participate in the sports and activities. the kids a your school try very hard to get over a D to participate in your activities. these kids wake up ever morning to go school to study and work hard. if you let these wonderful kids participate in the activities trust me they will try harder to get better grades and to make your school top in the state. these kids just don't want to work they want to have some fun with their friends. but once their fun is over they must go back to work. thank you for letting me share my opinion .
