I think is a good idea for young people to take a career a young age, because they are learning more stuff and when they going to the university they already going to know what career they are taking for their future, its good to them because they can be someone in their life doing their own stuff for them.

If they take a career in high school is going to be better learning the same stuff from the university. But is good idea if they take a career in the university because they can teach him better the stuff he need for a creer. The career is the future for young people doing the right stuff and thats why the most people want to take a career for their future, and high school are preparing them for the university. Thats why is good idea to selecte a career in high school thats the future for our lifes. The university help you a lot in the future if u want to be someone in your life you have to do the right things.

The university help you a lot in the future if u want to work in a big stuff, you can do it because u took the career in th euniversity.
