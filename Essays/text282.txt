I think if we never try something new we will never are going to grow more. I'm agree with

Emerson's because in this life the point is to try new ideas new experiences is not only stay in one place like if I already have something why can't try something different if I can move more far than where I am for example if I never try something that I always have wanted how am going to know what it's feel. One reason if I already have a mastered in something how im supossively to grow if I never have try it before how I will know if I am good for it Ifor not

I never try before.

Example If I am a person who has a mastered in bussines and I am able to have my own company but Iam scared to try how I am supposively to grow If I don't try I will stay in the same place where I srtart because is does not matter what I am mastered fpr it if I don't try I f I don't take the risk if I am not confident in my self. Unless I try to do something that I already have mastered I will never grow. I think everything depends in our own personallity because there are person that they are already old but some times they regret their selfs because they never try somethint that they could try it when they were young but now is to late for them I think those kind of things are important in life is not only a bachilletor degree is what you want in life is something that if you don't try is gonna stay in our lives forever and we wiil never are going to see that.

Another example for this is that we always have to go beyond that what we already know we never can stop in one place we need to keep going because there are more things to discovered and the more fast we are moving the more fast we start growing it. So every time we need to keep in mind that everything that we do is what is going to make us to look different then others and always be beyond in everything.
