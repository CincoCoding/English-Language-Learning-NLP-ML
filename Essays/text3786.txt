Some school dictrict shifted to a four day week and at ten hour for day, not because fo fenancial needs, but other did so to make it earser to schedule soporting event or after-school activities. On my opinion, my school should follow the model by extending the school day two hours. Beacuase they conserver enegy and resources.

The benefist of goint to a four-day week and ten hours day for schooling, is that if offers teacher and students an additional day of rest every week. More rest then equates to dealing with less strees over the courses of a school year. Students feel lees pressure, because they have more time to study at their own place at home, especially in the later grades. For example, I am senior in my school, if my school follow this model I will have more time for work in my homework.

The disadvantages of four-day week and ten hours day. Shifting do this schedule does have centain disadvantages, especially for the working parent. For the parents of yourger student, an aditional full day of daycare nay need be schoduled very weed Instead of a partial day this leads to added costs that some families, living paycheck to paycheck, may not be able to afford.

In conclusion, the school be should the four-day week and extending the school day two hours.
