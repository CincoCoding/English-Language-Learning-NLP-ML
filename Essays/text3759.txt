Spain is one of the most beautiful place in this world. Spain has lots of stuff, they have big soccer clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletico Madrid, and many more. They have big stadiums that whole over 100,000 people, they even have some nice features like they have have restruants inside the stadium, one of them has a bedroom inside.

Once I would arrive at Spain I would love to try their food because I heard their food was good sou

I sesrched it up and the food looks so yummy and tasty. I would also love to ride on a boat and cruise through the city. One of the good things is that it's hot most of time over there.

Barcelona is a beautiful city in Spain, they speak Catalan. Most of Spanish people would only speak Spanish but with an accent but Barcelona speaks Spanish and Catalan. That would one the languages i would love to learn. Spain has alot of great cities like Generic_City, Generic_City, Generic_City, and a whole bunch more. They each have a stadium.

The last place I would love to visit is the capital of Spain which is good. Generic_City is one of the best soccer team in the world. They have a lot of great players and a Big stadium.
