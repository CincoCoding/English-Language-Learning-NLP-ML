Working in a group is more benefitial than working alone because there are so many diferent ideas that the group members can have to achieve a great work.

The majority of students that I have asked about it say that working in group has been more succesful for them because in fact it is way faster,you get to share your ideas and support others. Many times that I have worked on something by my self I always wonder about many things or opinions about my work and it is hard for me to check if it is good or what would people think about my work.

It is also benefitial for teachers because students will have less questions for them,so teachers can use that time for grading or other things while the students are working in group. I have seen some teachers having a hard time grading and explaining at the same time because every single student is working by their own.

Teachers must have their students working in a group than alone because as I see it is more benefitial and better,this will have students to come up with better work and they also get to interact with diferent people and learn from them.
