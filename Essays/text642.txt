The firts impression are almost impossible to change. Do you think the first impression are almost impossible to change. Although some people think the first impression is imposible to change. actually is true is impossible to change.

The first impression is impossible to change. for example, when a friendo surprise me my first reaction is smile because, I fill so happy, exiting in this moment you maind no think in what happen arrond you first, the reacction when someone surprise me oh my God that is beautiful becasue, I never think one member of my family do something for me, secound reaction or impression for what is impossible to change is how you filling in that moment, what will be your first words, people see this in you that is soo exited becuase is the first impression nobody chage this becuase is my life my decitions. third when someone surprise me a bad day change in a good day, my family, friends or a girlfriendo do this

I never thing in the problems or in what situation I'm, oh men thisi smile nobody in this world chage how you filling when someone special in my life is whit my nobody change that moment soo special.

my conclution is when you have a bad day someone special in your life and traid to surprise this impression you never forget, The firs impresion nobody change. becuase is part of my life, the first impression is a good reaction becuase your happy, if you has a bad day that surprise changed the moment fot a good moment a momente with you not thing in what happen around you or in problems and this is my conclution for what I thing to the first impresion.
