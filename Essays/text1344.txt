Some people agree with the statement ''success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm'' because the failure help to learn how other's to be prepared and better understanding. But many people disagree with Churchill's for the reason what they don't believe in the failure because if they fail something they do better the next time. Since, no one is perfect everybody have something bad and something good this don't make a different the other's.

Although many people concern the failure how something the need due for doing a better person in the life but that does the means they can't due. Some people thinking what the failure is important for they life because they learning a new things and they put all of they for doing good person. Clarity, this people due everything for not failure something.

Additionally, many people don't believe in the faillure they say is somenthing happed in the life for doing a better person. If they fail a class or don't pass the class they keep trying and never give up. Surely, with failers they learn from the expirence they will not loss the enthusiasm.

Ask you can see failure is not always a good way to major sucess. One need to success failure is put a attention and due a better person and trying hard. If this people trying the things wiil be better in they were doing. Although all many people are success with failure.

Truely, failure is part of life and we need to understand our failers so the we can successed. By understanding our failers learn how doing better and not worry about the failers. Since they are worry about the failers one can have more enthusiasm to success.
