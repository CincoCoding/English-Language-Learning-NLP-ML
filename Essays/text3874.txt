Do you think that students should be able to take classes in school that benefits them in the fucher?

In this paper i will argue that if students should take class that that will guide them towards a specific career. should student consider their career pass at a young age,yes because when the student gets older and becomes a adult he or she wont have to have a boring and low paying job.

Im am in the eleventh grade and I already know that i want to be when in older, I want to be a U.S.M solder.

The class that am taking right now in high school that will help me become what I want to be when am older is JROTC.

You may ask that is JROTC?

JROTC is a class that teaches student about the United State Armed Forces.

Another class that am taking in my school that will help me with my fucher career is Econ and Finals.

Econ and Finals is a class that is a high school requirement to graduate, but i like that class because i know that its going to help me with my fucher career.

What if we dont start preparing are self for are fucher careers after high school we'll be loss, confused,and broke too. In my family i dont think anyone do what they wanted to do i high school . I remember my mom telling me that she wanted to become a Aries but she never became a Aries because in her old school they did't have art and she dropped out to have family.

Working is something everyone have to do.

So agree that its a good idea to start finding something you will like to do when your older in high school,

When i grow up i want to be a United Stated Marin solger and i konw that the classes im taking will help me become that one day.
