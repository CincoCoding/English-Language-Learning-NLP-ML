I agree because in life you can achieve many goals and pass through so many good things like me i always think positive thats why so many good things happen to me also never disagree because in life you never know what could actually really happen maybe something bad that you have no clue about . Life is great if you keep a positive attitude for example give people advice on somethig good maybe one day they will do the same for you be greatfull with what you have or get beacsue soem people dont have what you have and they really want . Thats why i always have a postive attitude beacuse when i make good discissions i get what i want.

Here are some examples of why you shoud agree for example you get a job a costumer comes by needs help you give them a positive attitude they will give you a positive attitude to help eachother out give them respect talk to them nicely you never know something good could happen second of all what could happen if you give them a bad attitude they will give you the same attitude to. Look at the bright side what happens when you them a positive attitude and they give you a bad attitude you keep the same attitude no matter what they will see and think to their head wow he or she has a nice attitude while the perrson is giving them and ungreatfull attitude.

Always be the bigger person with great attitude even if the person is having a bad day probably try to give them a positive attitude and probably you might cheer them up its always good to make people feel good about themselves afterwards you will feel good because you helped them out . Its never a bad thing to have a positive attitude because good things will come to you .
