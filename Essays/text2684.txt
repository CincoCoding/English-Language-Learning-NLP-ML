A students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early is a bad idea, maybe have a lot of problem after they are finish high school for three years.

However, finish high school in three years is a good thing to think about it, students will move faraway and move on their life, but that are a small group of students who are thinking one way of their life after three years high school, but the other group of students are have a problem after they finish high school and they need help to resolve the problem they are in. For the students who are have problem need help to resolve, they problem are they making more decision that let they think about can the students do it or can the students sure about this decision or that decision, because is a big decision to change one person life and it happen to every students even the greatest student.

Three years students don't have enough time to think more about their future and not 100% sure about they really are in future, have a lot of students who are finish three years high school and have a good jobs or have a good place to live, not everyone the same life so some students before finish three years of high shool know what they are doing and after high school they making other decision. Four years students they are more ready for the decision and they are have more time to think about what and where they will be in their future, and they got all help from teacher and parent to help that think in mind steady.

Students are mostly don't finish high school three years they have less experiment about college then students who are three years high school, however the three years high school students have more problem then a four years high school students, three years high school students maybe on the time they thinking what they doing next if they can't make it or they are changes they carrer they end up stay with their parent forever into they know what to do next and on the time they off school the those student going to forget everything that they had learn in school and end up failing.

My opinions is every students need more time to think about their carrer in future, before step forward into their life they needs more time to think and do whatever they need in every class and think for their carrer.
