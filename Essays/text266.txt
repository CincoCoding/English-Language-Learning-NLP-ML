"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."

Introverts can easly feel identificated with Waldo's words, in a world where the majority goes in the same diretion trying to convince themslves that the way they are taking is the best, it is just a fantacy, but sadly unique, and genius people are afected by the same.

As time passes most of us we still refusing to be like the rest of society; I trully belive that being yourself is more importar than a life lacked of happiness.

As we growing up we been told how to be, and who we have to be like, but only people who resists and face world's opinion can really know deeply what self-acceptation is. It is not about ego, it is about reallity. God, Universe or whowever gave us life, also gave us a purpose. Being different is not a crime, but a privilege, so we have to take advantage of it. Life has a lot of perspectives, just because they are right, does not mean I am wrong.

Before my favorite artist passed away, he used to say: "I rather to be hated for who I am, than be loved for who I am not." well, I think Emerson would love this quote. People that choose a diferent direction are usually called: black sheep, weirdos, misfits, and even crazy. In most of the cases they end up being rejected, just because how they look, how they dress or how they think. but it is a fact that no long they become the most greatness, successfull and happiest people in the world, and there is a few of them. well, I guess no pain, no gain.

I know is hard to be yourself when all these people are judging, in my opinion it is a really big accomplishment being yourself, even in these modern times. I never understood why we have to be like someone else just to be accepted in this cruel society but I know for fact that being myself is the best feeling I've ever felt, so I trully believe that being yourself is more important than a life lacked of happiness.
