I argree with haveing a afterschool homework club, because It well help out alot of students improve in school, and do better overall.

also don't you want extral help when you need it? students are the same they want help on schoolwork and homework cause it could be difficult.

students don't really like difficult homework, so they give up and do something else, but with a homework club they can go afterschool and do the work there teachers can help students out.

for example I sometimes need help, so I have a teacher that helps me at home with my work and my parntents has to pay that teacher. and some parntants don't have the money to pay for a teacher, so if we can work togather to make a club that helps out students that would be great for the students, and the parntents would not have to pay alot of money to make they child good at school.

a other example would be that students can stay afterschool with there teachers, but for a little bit of time, so if were going to have a homework club lets make it more than 47 minumies. More time equlas a lot of work getting compled.

in conclusion we need a homework club it can help out a lot of students and save a lot of pernts money, and also make stundents pass more tests and help tham on schoolwork, and make students feel like difficult work is easy since they got all the help they need from the afterschool club, also if some teachers don't feel like staying for another they could just let the students help each other and let the teacher rest.

overall I think this idea is very good, and well help out a lot of students with there work.
