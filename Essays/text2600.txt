I agree with Thomas Jefferson about accomplishing myself every time i do something, i think if we always woke hard or at least be with the mentality to work we will always get stuff done without even thinking about it. Most people realize how they can get there work done when they are actually doing something. You can do anything if you really think like Thomas Jefferson, Just like most of the people say '' Work hard to be succeful

'' if you never do nothing you will never finish what you have to do. Just think about how much people wanna be the same thing we wanna be , if you really wanna be succesful you have to work and you will always get stuff done.

Most people dont be active all the time and they take advantage of technology because now days technology can do everything. Nobody have any excuse for no finishing work. we live in a world where if u be smart doing what u suppose to do you will get it ''DONE''. One good example is:The president just think how much work he have to get done to make a country look good,no problems,etc.

It really is wonderful how much work can we finish if we always doing theres no excuse for not doing work Just like i said i think that everybody who work a lot they gonna accomplish more every time they doing something and think how fast they did it just because you are not thinking about how much work you have to get done and never think inactivity also serve a purpose because if u dont do nothing you will not be the person you always think about or goals you have in mind, Every goal or career you wanna do takes time and time goes fast so you have to take advantage of everything and make sure you always doing what you suppose to do and not wasting your time saying i will do it next time because theres no next time.
