The technology had negative effects on people's lives because now they can not do nothing without phone or they dont talk in person with nobody that importan to talk in person because you can see with who are talking. If you do everything with your phone you can loose you vision beacuse the telephone has to much light, but you can play the games and not talking with nobody.

for example in this time the parents when their children start crying they just give them the cell phone, why they do that beause they now the kids gonna addicted to wacht videos then that gonna be a problem with the kids when they grow up they don ganna talk with nobody but that not de kids fall beacuse they parents teach then how to use the cell phone but they dont teach them how to talk with people, they need to lear how to talk with older people or teach them how to do other stuff.

this is another example when parents go to the shopping stores and they are in the store they losse their kids they are always in the phone they never can missed call but they can missed their kids that not make sense because when they found the kids they star to saying thing.

my opinion is we need to talk more share our ideas or meet more friend that better to be everyday in the phone talking with people's like my mother always told me dont tlak with bad people but the thing is we never now when they are bad but that why we need to do everything carefull, is better to meet peoples in person.
