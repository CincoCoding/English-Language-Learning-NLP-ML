It is a good idea, a lot of students like to do that, because for them is a good opportunity, is not easier for the students who wanna graduate early but when they finish the school, they have more time and is easy that they think about collage and what they wanna do in collage. Also is depend if the student want to, but for me it's a good choice, the student have to take summer school, be honest it's not a lot of work.

Many students saying that is preferable take the four years because we are young and we have time to think what we wanna do, but not, is logical that the student that wanna graduate early have more time than the student that wanna take for years in the school.

Many students wanna graduate early but their parents saying no, so they can't graduate early because their parents saying that is a bad choice and a lot of things more, each person think different but for me is a really good choice.

For me is a good opportunity because i can think in what i wanna do with my life, because basically i have one more year, but something that happens with the students that graduate early is that they take a brake in that year and when they going to begin the collage they feel tired and they don't wanna go to collage because they feel tired and that is not a reason for not go.

Why not graduate early, if it is a good idea, it can feel free and it can thinking about collage without pressure.

If i wanna graduate early obviously i have to work a little be more, but i will have the chance to have one more year and in that year i can work in something good and productive for my school life. If a student gonna graduate early and in that year do nothing, he will lost his time and that's bad.

So for me it is a very good idea, if i know how to work with my time and i know what i want to do in collage it is a very good idea for the students who wanna graduate early.
