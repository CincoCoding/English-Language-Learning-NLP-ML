Do you think that student is much better graduate in 3 years early in High School? In the articule, I will argue that this program is a great opportunity to finish High School and start college early, But has to take some courses on summer school or evenings or if not are able to graduate in 3 year. Student can finish early High School. Student could start early college. Student can start to work. Student has the opportunty to finish High School and start to think in a new career in college. Student who graduate early has a opportunity to find a job and help to their family. I never can do it to graduate me early beacuse i made some crazy thing in my past that i can go back and make a correction, but this a good opportunity for all of them that can graduate early on High School. Should student be able to graduate High School in 3 year early? Some say that is not good to graduate in 4 year, but i say is better graduate in 3 year early as i coudn't do it at this time is too late to make me a correction on my life. In the future, i would like to my sons finish High School early if they can, to they have a better future than i was they will be better than me and never give up to find their future. In conclusion, students are able to finish High School early with complete all their requirement courses, then is better to graduate 3 year early at High School and i will let my sons know that make their effort and don't make my mistake to make then a better than i am. Thank you so much to take the pleasure to read my issue.
