One place i would like to go visit in this world would be portorico because it looks like a wonderful place to live in and because i want to experince how it is to live there or how school is for them. It might be a life changing for me to see how they live there maybe i might start being greatful for what i have and they dont and i would start helping others mor often.

One reason i would go to portorico is to see how they do stuff different like what they wear,what they eat, and what they do on daly it would be intersting seeing all that and i would like to try new food and wear the cloths they wear and try to see how it feels to be a portorican.

Another reason i would love to go to portorico is because at the USA i am not greatful for what i have and maybe if if i go over to portorico i will be greatful for what i have because i will see the difference of how i live and how they live it will also melt my heart to see them eating unhealth and i am over here throwing my food away because i dont want it.

My final reason for wanting to go to portorico is because i will want to see how their parents are with the kids like when they get in trouble. I also want to see how teachers are with their students when they get in trouble because i want to see if they are different than El Salvador cause there they hit their students with the ruler and that is not okay.

In conclution I would like to see every difference they have from the USA and El Salvador and i want to try every food that they have and spend time with students. I want to be greatful of everything that i am able to have and they dont and maybe share the stuff that i have and they dont. Now i really want to go to portorico and explore new stuff and have a nice adventure.
