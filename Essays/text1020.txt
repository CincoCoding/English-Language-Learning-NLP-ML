Dear, Principal

Its a good thing that your require all students to perform community service, Because its a good thing that we should have are community clean . I think we should have it clean because what if someone from another state comes to are state there going to see how dirty it is . They will start talking bad of are state and people would not come no more . Also if that family was thinking to move were we live , there going to change there mind ,because they saw how dirty it was and people want a place to live and were is clean . So Principle is a good thing that you trying to change that. Not all students could do that also adults they could help too .

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
