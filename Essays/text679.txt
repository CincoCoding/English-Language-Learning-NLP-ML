It's good to have afterschool homework club, because it could help to understand the homework and be great at it. For example, I went to afterschool homework club in every tuesday and thursday at my old school for English. I thought it will be bored, but then it was fun and easy to understand. Sometimes in homework clubs, They do fun lesson to under what to do on the homework. For example, at my old homework club, We sometimes have a field trip to the public library to some fun lesson. In homework club, you sometimes get help from the teacher, or classmates. At my old homework club, We sometimes video chat to some famous authors. Sometimes we play fun games with the principal. But there are thing to get used to, Like you need to know if someone is picking you up, or you are ride the bus. For example, I forget my mom is not picking me up, because she was at work. It took me two hours for a ride, because everyone in my family was busy. And you leave two hours later the your regular time to leave school. The goal in Afterschool homework clubs is helping student to understand the subject that have trouble on.
