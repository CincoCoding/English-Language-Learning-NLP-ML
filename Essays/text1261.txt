If you alone in the world you can make nothing if you trying to make somehting you can't because somebdoy support to you, you can't associate with the technology and you can dessarollate nothing maybe just you can survive and after then you dead, I think i'm agree with Emerson's Wrote,because when you can make all you want individuality i think you can be better because you dont need help to other person or something,so all your responsabilities is with you,when you need to help to the other person somethimes everithing to be fine and somethimes no,because somethimes your plans about you want to do or about you thinking is not really well like about you imaginate to do,the imagination is other thinks,you can imaginate all you want but in reality all your imagination is not the same because you can imaginated much thinks but in the real life you can't make all your imagination about you want is like imposible doing all your imagination perfect,so my conclusion is we can live alone in the world but you need support to the people too because the same time all the world desarollate,and the same time we destroy the world cause we make much contamination,deforetation, we create much machines ruin the world,change climated. I think the author waldo Emerson wrote he reference about like what you doing alone in one world if you care the world o destroy de world if u can alone or need support the people.
