One day my mom told, " son, be positive in your life,and everything will be of success". Since i started to be more positive in my life, everything was looking better, i found the job that i wanted, i bought my first car, and, me and my family move to a new house, overall everything was looking better. Based on my experience people should be positive and be around positive people, listen to positive music and found activities that incorporate positive attitude.

People should find new friends that give good vibes and help them become a better person, because sometimes the problem might not be themselves , might be people thats around you telling bad stuff, and always making you a have a bad day.

Changing the music that you listen to, could help you be more positive, because most of the songs and artists that most people listen to these days, sign about, drugs, killing people, gang related stuff, and thats good if you want to be positive.

Founding activities that incorporate positive attitude could help also, like going to church, going to the movies with the family, or going to a motivational speeches, will get you into a positive mood and forget about all those negative stuff going on in your life.

Being positive is good, and it makes you feel good and have success in life, but not always is good, because, life sometimes is unfair and we have to deal with it, we cant be leaving thinking that everything is good, when the reality is that the world is getting worst and worst everyday.

Looking ahead in the future, i see the new generation incorporating positive activities over the whole world, and making the whole world see life of a good and successful perspective.
