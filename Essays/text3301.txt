When we get there they went to pick us up , my first impression was to see all my family back again and that impression i will never forget it , and it will be never be change.

We went to my grandmother's house, i was nervous because in that day i haven't see my dad for more than 8 years, and when he came through the door i got that impression of seeing him again, i was so happy to see him again.
