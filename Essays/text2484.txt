dear principal,

I would like you to change the policy to at least a b to get in sports because people would work harder for it and because you would have much more people passing school and getting healthier. It would get more people cunserned on there grade and will ask for help to there teacher or they would stay after school for tottering. people would do better in sports because they learned how to do it. And it would make the collages wont them even more. It also make less people feal on there test or any exam because they would have studied allot more then they have before. people would wont to work so hard to get in any sports they wonted and when the get that score that they wonted they would be happy of what they got
