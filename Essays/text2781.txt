Dear, Principal

I think your students should have community service but i think its only fair to the people that do something bad to do community service, because for example some of the students at school litter and if they do and you catch them you should make them do community service for littering. not all students should do that only the kids that act up because if you put all the kids in that your gana be taking their time away and its gana be worst there gana get mad.

Sincerely,
