yes i am agree with Emerson statement: if we attempt to do something in our life to make a better life or what we have already otherwise we will never Develope.

what kind of attempting we have to do for development? we need to have education for development that we can make our life better.

we can start our education from beginning of our life which is called school, college, university, and etc.

we should learn and keep our education in these places until we reach to our goal and success.

education is a best option for us that we can know everything, make our mistake correct, and we try to receive our diploma as soon as possible by hard studying, and every day learning the new things base on our life.

we should looking for the way that we can grow our self and do not lose our opportunity in during our life.

education is a process of life can grow your mind to better know about new stuff. this is a chance probably happen for one time, but it doesnt matter whenever you get it. basically when the students finish these process,

they will graduate, and then they will gain their diploma from any of those places after that, they will become a educated person with a high careers in their society.

although, some of the people dont like studying, or maybe they dont want it, they are preferring work careers instead of education.
