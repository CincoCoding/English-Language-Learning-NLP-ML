Technology has a good and bad effects, it allows us complete task without having contact with others. Also just makes things so much easier for us. Technology developed over time so quickly, i remember, i used to had a flip phone but, now there is iphone X. No buttens at all and the face ID. Much as the technology developes the people will be seperated from each other.

Tesla just intreduced Tesla Model X. It has an auto pilot mode. Self driven car. Also they announced they making tunnel just for the auto pilot mode. Elon Musk says "its much cheaper then the normal tunnel and safer".

And he mentions on his tweeter "Working on something","flying car picture". So he is already working on the new tech. It's only 2019, can you imagine how technologies would be in next 10 years?. It will be keep developing and devepoling. It won't stop. We will get to some point, we don't even have too see each other or talk to each other.

Nowadays kids doesn't play outside, they have their IPad, Xbox and PC. Even the babies got IPad. If you give the baby IPad,

the babies would be distracting them selves. It's much easier for the moms too. But some point kinds gets addicted to it. Crying and sometimes they just won't eat anything. Smart phones can be really dangerous to the eyes.

Technologies can be helpful but, it can cause negative effects.
