"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else a gretest accomplishment"

I agree with Emerson's statement it's important be yourself always and think about your future, depends own decisions what do you wanna be also we can to achieve our goals. In the world we have so many opportunities, everyone can do it, all can try no matter how many times you make a mistake, no matter what the people say about you. Just believe in yourself and be happy.

even if you dont feel sure about something like one day when i was working i was not sure about what i was supposted say like i was scared cause was my firts day at work and that what the costumer gonna say.

Sometimes i dont want talk cause its little bit hard speak another languaje but when they say you will be fine or they say positive things about me, that's means that always you find people that they support you and they give to encourage and different ways. Many times it's important take off the negative mind and be positive.

at school see kids that also have the same and also i remember when i start my firts days of the school was like that but if you be yourself and try to make you goals you can do more than you think. its better to focus in your own future than in someone else's bunisses, last saturday my friend's team won the final and i was so proud about the,

its important believe and try to support other people because they can make great accomplishment also.

finally, the best way to try got greatest accomplishment is be yourself and believe in yourself.
