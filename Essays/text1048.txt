Have you ever had a subject that you liked or you know it so well? If I

had a chance to talk to a elementary school, I will teach them about English. The reason why I would chose English because you will need to know it throughout you whole life, you need to know how to use correct grammar, and its easy to learn. English is fun and easy to use whenever you need it.

America you will need to know the basic language and thats English, you will use English throughout your whole life. In school you will start learning English in preschool and it goes throughout your whole life. When people come from other places that are not in America some people have trouble speaking English because they have not learned about it. So if you have not learned it when you were young it going to really hard for you to understand. When you get older and you have a job you will need to talk to people and you will need to know how to write and type. Even though if you dont have a job you will still need to learn how to speak English. When you need to do important work for the government or tax work, you need to sign and write you information.

Also, will need it when your in school you well need it everyday by writing your name to writing a whole essay and it needs to not have any grammar problems. You will also need when you have a job and if you become a teacher you will need to learn the more detail information. When there is important information that you will need to sign your address, you will need to add commas and that involves you learning English. Finally, this is the reason why its important to learn English because you will need to know the grammar to it.

Third, English is the easiest to learn because if you get how to write you will know it for your whole life. If you learn how to use commas and other things then you will learn it for your whole life. There is three things that you will need for English and it how to speak, or write, and grammar. You will need those things for essay projects and more. It is easy to learn because you are using it for your whole life over and over and when you do things over and over and it gets stuck in your head. English is also fun because when you get something it makes you feel good. You might not know but you are using everyday even if there is now school you are texting or writing a letter. This is another reasons why I would like yo teach a class about English because it easy and at the same time its fun.

First, speaking English is not really hard and it will become really useful.
