To being with, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of then hours. Schools are planing to do two hours of school each week. The disadvantages of doing such a thing to school are, Schools are reducing school hours, teachers won't be getting a salary instead they will get pay hourly, and the economic is going to be low.

I believe that, school days shouldn't be reduce ,just because they want to save energy. Students must be at school for eight hours. Otherwise the teachers won't have the time to give the given material. Students studies will get interrupted if they get two hours of school weekly.

Second reason, is that teachers won't be getting a salary for two hours of work. The pay checks will be reduce to hours worked during the week just like any other job that pays by hour. That means that those people need a secondary job so they can support themselves

Finally, the economic will increase because businesses are reducing peoples hours just because they want to save up energy. People have debts to pay like credit cards, health/car insurance etc. Food cost will highly increase its price.

In conclusion, employers shouldn't reduce peoples hours. it is a good idea to reduce the energy that we consume but in away it's also affecting our economic and learning system.
