It has been aid that first impressions are almost impossible to change. For me i think you can change from the first impression. First of all you can come off as someone who don't care about anything or any one but when you get to know them your mindset change on how they are in your eyes. the second reason is i had someone that i thought that was the one the person i thought i can spend my life with i know it sounds crazy but my first impression was she was a good girl then i got to know her and found out she's nothing but plane evil and has nothing but hate in her soul and always trying to find something to blame me for just looking for es cues for her to do what she wants to do and Little do she knows its making my love for her fading away every step of the way. so in conclusion this is why i think that first impression arent really impossible to change because people family even loved ones change that why i think first impression can change.
