I'm very interested in the nurse and now there's an opportunity that school tell us to strive for an internship in this hospital, i'm very glad to attend this competition. Because i really like and also thirst for be a nurse and i think nurse can help a lot of people.

First, i usually learn some knowledge about nurse in books or online. There's some books that people write their experience about how could they become a nurse, how the nurse job looks like and also some story that they have met. Actually i know, it's a hard job to learn, even my first language is not English, it become harder. But when i see the story, see the interesting experiment, i'm fascinated. Sometimes, i also go to find some volunteers about nurse, it always help me learn a lot that i can't learn from the book.

Second, i think to be a nurse is arrogant. People always say " Nurse is just like an angle", they help people from disease. As i said, i have read a story that makes me shake: Once in a night, the nurse was ready to finish her work, but suddenly, a man run in to the hospital and there's blood in his arm, he said somebody want to hurt him, that nurse keep him in to the restroom and called 911 first, she try her best to bind up his arm, she wrote in the book" I'm so scary and my hand was shaking, but soon i clam down, i know i'm the hope for him". This story makes me have different understanding about nurse, this job can even save people's life. What a mighty job it is!

In conclusion, i hope i can get this opportunity, this hospital have high opinion in VA, and there's more projects that can makes me learn. This is a rare chance for me and i have plenty of time during the summer brake.
