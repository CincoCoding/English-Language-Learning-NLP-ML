when theres a problem its a chance for you to do your best. I agree with this statement because when you in a problem you give up, you dont know what to do, and you try your best to find out why its hard or why its a problem.

when I play soccer there was one problem, I never passed the ball to my teammates. The coach always got mad at me for not passing the ball. Sometimes I gave up because I forget to pass the ball. There was no way that I can remember to bass the ball. The coach always tells me in every game to pass the ball.

I dont know what to do to remember to pass the ball. If the other team has it I attack to get the ball but when I get it on my feet I cant pass because its hard. The only thing I can do is go in Google or YouTube so it can help me. Sometimes I don't know what to do to get better, its hard watching YouTube or going to Google is the only thing I can do to get batter, or not forget to pass, and help me. I search up "why do I never pass the ball and how can I get better to pass or not forget to pass the ball." It helped me a lot and now I started trying my best to get better at soccer and its going good so far. every game i have passed the ball.

when you have a problem its your chance to try/succeed. when you have a problem you need to try your best, try not to give up, and try not to get confuse or it will be even harder for you.
