In my opinion.

I agree with Emerson to be right when he wrote everyone can do eny things, but not every one wants to work hard to do.

Example.

In my personan I think to have my own helicopter in the future.

In this word evething goods is posible something more than more beyonnd whtaever my effort my or how many i give to soporting them. Even in my life or my phat way so many dificult, but I velieved in my faiht there is nothing impossible.

But i have to work hard to get them ,because nothing come easy ,everything have price first then came be true, But I can't lose nothing to try ,try and try becouse wiil be successful In the future.

Even if I see now only in my dream and, dream in my future it's already mastered.

The people never grow because they fear to try, to do some bighest or highest is the most enemig byself .I can't grow more toll,but I tread believed in my self and first God, will be grow me in wisdom that is my best part I can't do by mayself,the first thing to is to have good health, and my family to.

So I agree to do something beyon what I already Mastered.
