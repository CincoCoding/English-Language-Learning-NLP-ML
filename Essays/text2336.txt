Prime Minster Winston Churchill once said that "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." This quote indecteds that becoming successful is a lie in life that dose not have challenges,failures and have hard time in life to achive your goals and, without making it intersting. However, a lot of people belives this quote, because success is nothing with haveing enthusiasm and, lossing or being fail on something and being positive about it.

First, Haveing successful life without challenges is result of being fail in your success. The reason why you should have challenges in life to become a succesful its to make you a a better person in life and to make you a critical thinker and to garner your all skills and your talents for the better future. For example if you face your challenges later in life you would have the benfits from that hard or easy challenges.

secondly, makeing you challenigs intersting would led to be come successful, the reason why because having intersing and positive attuide towards your challengs would make it easire to handle. For example if your lossing a bussines or challnge do not bring nagitive atomsphere around it because it would never let your mind to have more oppotrunity that you could done more.

In my piont of view, failing or lossing is lie if you do not try hard for the intersting and successful goals. If you are lossing a challenge it okay to loss but with positive thought and never give up on the difficults challenge you have to face in you way to successful life and gaols. However a lot of people gives up on the diffecult challenges because its too hard for them to handle and at end they would have more diffcult thing to face. Make your challenges intersting it dose not matter if you fail it it matter how you play it.
