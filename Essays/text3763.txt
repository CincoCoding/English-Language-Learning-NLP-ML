Imagination and knowledge are all come from you mine, but what are the different between those two? Scientist Albert Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge." I'm agree with him, because if you take a class like art or computer graphs, you don't really need your knowledge, the most important thing you need, is your imagination. It can help you do better in the class.

first, the different between Imagination and knowledge is you don't need to rember the knowledge, and sometimes people have hard time to remberm. So you just need to think you like to do, and you don't need to follow the knowledge what you learn. I'm that kind of person that don't like to rember things, but I like to do what in my mine want to do. We have a lot knowledge need to learn, and we never finished learning, but we can use our imagination to do more things that is helpful to the world.

I guess, everybody like to play video games, but do you know how they make the games up? I did create app club this fall, first I thought we will create some app what other people already create it before, but than the teacher told us that, everybody will be create in they are own app, I don't know what kind of app I want to create, and told the teacher said, "can I create a one somebody just create it before?" "No, you can't, you need to be imagination, just think of what you want to do, and what kind of app you like." She answer. the end of the due day, I use my imagination to create a game app. From this class I learn that imagination is more important than knowledge.

Imagination and knowledge are both important, but imagination is a little better than knowledge, we can use our imagination to do more helpful things to our beautiful world. In our life we have too much knowledge need to learn, we need to keep learning and nerve stop.
