i belive working as a group is more beneficial , because if you have the right crew you get to get so much done invest in stuff and finish it and you get to earn more money as a group team.

working alone now im not to sure , when you work alone it can be quite challenging because you have alot stuff to do and you not sure if you might finish it unless if its a small task. If it was a big task then it might take you the whole day or two days.

i have experience as working in a group we had to finish 6 palletes unless makeing it 2 left , we finished the pallets so quickly that we thought where gonna leave early but we got some together finished.

now working alone man.. that was challenging i tried finishing at least one but i couldnt because there was so much stuff in one pallet and i got to say i was new in that department , then thats when they sent me help.

working as a group is much more helpful then working alone theres alot of different benifits as working alone and as a group but in picking which is more better i will say working as a group unless if its a samll task and you know you can get it done.
