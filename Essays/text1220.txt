The first impressions is importance for people. It's almost impossible to change, I'm agree with this statement, for example, you saw an ugly food, you not eating it, anyhow it good eating or no. Next, if one person give you bad inpressions, maybe you not try to talk to him or her. Finally, if you want to shopping, you will saw the appraisal about the store.

First, when you go to any restaurant to finish lunch or dinner, you want a perfect food for yourself. you waiting for food like 15 minute, after 15 minute, the food coming, but, the food looking for squeamish, you will disappointment, because, you feeling it's a bad food and can't eating that. If are pretty food on you desk, you don't care how was food, just try it first.

Secondly, you parents introduce someone to you, this guy talking too mach, the mouth can't stop,

just like fly. however, you hate people talk too much and want quiet. Than,behave of this guy let you discontent. you will hate this guy also, want leave to him or her. This impression will let you apart to this guy.

Third, when you go to shopping with best friend, but, here are new place for your guys, just came only 1 day, you don't know anywhere to shop, than you will check to cell phone to find a store. When you find a store, the things looking for pretty, your want to go, however, your saw the all appraisal are bad, only 3 or 4 appraisal are good, than, you will change other one, because, your think the quality of needs are bad.

Finally, the first impressions is hard to change, looking for the people one time, first impressions will in you head. Regardless to change, arise in you head almost are first impressions, because an effect of first time to meet are unforgettable.
