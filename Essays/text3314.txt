That's why I think that expending the school day two hours is something not very good. For some students are very complicate to extending the school day two hours. Because some student have to work in the afternoon,

I think the benefits and disadvantage to a four-day school week, can be good, but also can be sad.

Becauase not everyone is agree with all this that happens in the school, a four-day school week have good ideas and bad ideas. For the disagvantage is that we can be out so late, and that is something that not everyone liked, and the benefits is that is only four-day per week. But the benefits is that all students only come four-day per week. And i think is better get out early, because some student have something to do, and get out so late is not a good idea for all students.

Some student can be not agree with all this, that extending the school for two hours. Beacuse I think that is not a good idea for all the students, and that can effect because if they working in the afternoon. That's why
