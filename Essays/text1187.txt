Do you think that the programs of graduate in three year is a good way?

some school need student that they have online classes and they can graduate before than three year for one part the program of graduate in three year is not good, because is more hard, My brother need help for teachers for graduate, and in the school classes he learn more, and he pay many attention to the teacher because he want graduate in three year etc.

some student take this program in summer school, because they want to finish the high school in three year, and go to the college in less time.

The program of graduate in three years is not good because student need help for the teacher, student learn more with teacher help, and they pay a better attention etc.

The program of graduate in three year is good, because you graduate in less time, and you can go in summer school for graduate the next year, but is more hard, more responsibility, and more work etc.

Should the school districts offer this programs? this programs offer many opportunity to graduate in three years, so i think that this is good for student, and they can have more opportunity to graduate in three years.
