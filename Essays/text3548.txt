Should people make their own decitions, or should they follow, others experts and authorities about life's experience. However from what think if you are alone out of no where and you don't have any exprerience is much better because you get to have your experiences and no one bothers yours plans. You make your own decitions and follow your own rules. On the other hand if you have some one on your back that do have more experiences them you they will be correcting you and bodering bothering you. Some people think that is better to follow some one decitions, but others think that is better to be alone because you must create your own decitions and follow yours rules is like you have a family no one is going to correct what are going to do with your family you don't follow others people they may be incorrect and you are correct and is better to be alone becuse you make your onw family whit your decitions and your rules.

To begin alone is better because you make your experiences from the mistakes.

you make your own decitions, but went you make a decition that coust you a mistake you get to have more experiences from the mistake that you did and went you have experiences from the mistake you learnd from the mistake that you need to be more responsible went you have a mistake you get to have a big experiences and that make you more strong and what you do and that makes you feel good and you become more responsible from the things that you do form the experiences that you have some people see that and they will have a hope on you and that you are going to be some one in the future and they will know you better because you are alone and not with some one that has more experiences you will raise you and your decitions.

Another think is that you must follow your own rules that you make. When you make your own rules no one is going to say some think to you they will follow your rules if they want to be with you however if you are with some one that has more experiences you must follow their rules and you dont want that to happent went you make your own rules and follow your rules you will know what is goint to happen but if you follow some one else rules you must be awear because you dont know what is going to happen, so is better to make your decitions your rules because you know that is good from what are you going to do so make your own rules and follow your own rules dont follow some one else rules you become more strong and more smart person.

Fanally the last reason why you should be aonle is that no one is going to bother you you will make every thing in your hands and no some one else hand they will not be on your back bothering you you will make every thing posible on your hand and if you are alone you will become and expert on the jod,company,schools the things that you do you will be the head on your decitions and you are no going to use some one else head and if you use their head they will correct you in what you do and if you do is like from what they thing is better ithey will be bodering you and that is not to good because it will be bad why it will be bad? Because they will make where do you walk in a way that you must don't want to walk they will make every thing possible to walk in their way and you want to walk in your way thier will make every thing possible they will bother you and no yuo must follow your way and your road to make every thing possible to have your own experiences and your own rules.

To conclude people must make their own decition, they should not be with some one else that has experiences or some tipe of company you must star from zero and trow the procces you will get to have some experiences from the mistakes that you did while you where working and wnet you have more experiences you will get to be more storng and you will grow in the things that you know and some people look at you and they will have a hope on you that you will make it to the end. On the other hand you must create your own rules you must be very organice on the rules that you make dont follow others person rules make your own rules and went yuo make your own rules you must know what is going to happen if every thing is going to be okay or bad, but if you follow some one else rules you will not know what is going to happen do must make your own rules so you can be unique and a expert. In adition, if you are alone no one is going to bother you in the things that you make becuase you are alone you are the boss no one is going to some some thing to you and you will guide others people went they see that you are alone and no with some one else you will grow alot in the thisngs that you do. Fanally you know now that the best thing is that you should be alone and no with some one else that they will make your own rules and you will learn from their experiences and you will not get to have your own experiences and no one is going to bother you is you are alone because of hall of that you must be alone and star from zere Thanks.
