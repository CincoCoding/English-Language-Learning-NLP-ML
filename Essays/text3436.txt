Being yourself is being true to yourself and to others for example. When you're hanging out with a group of people. Don't act like someone else but yourself because you will get caught for trying to be someone that you're not and get made fun of for being something that you're not. It's better to be yourself because you want people to like who you really are. Not someone you ain't your just lying to yourself and others.

Ralph Waldo Emerson was a Author who believe ''to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment''. I agree with that statement but not so many could say the same. There is many human on this planet who cant accomplishment being their self than being someone else than their self .

Many people struggle to be their self because of society. Society brain washes people to be someone else than being their self.

Nowadays being yourself is lame and being someone else is Amazing to some people. Their is con on being someone else like lying to people until they fine out who you really are. Than they might not like who you really are then your feelings are hurt . Therefore your friendless and hurt ,But you could always pick yourself up by being yourself. Than by over time people will start to notice how you change and they will want to have relationship with you.

It's healthy to have relationships with you being yourself than being someone else. The reason why i am saying that is because you dont want to be lying to the other person the whole time during the relationship . It will bring problems to the relationships .However its always a good idea to talk it out and come clean.
