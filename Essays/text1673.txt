Is important to learn from other people experiences? The answer is yes, because they don't want you to do the same that they did. In this essay I would talk about why is important to learn others people experiences. In my point of view, learning the experiences of others is important, because you learn something that someone had already commit that mistake and they tell you not to do when you grow.

First, one person that had shared their experiences with me is one of my friend. He had tell me plethora of experiences that he had when he was young. One of the experiences that he had tell me. Is that when he had the same that I have, he use to go out of the house without asking permission to his parents. Almost every week he used to lived the house without permission. One day, he realized that he was doing something wrong, so he stop going out of the house without permission. He tell me his experiences, because he want me to learn that is your are below 18 you still have to ask permission to you parents to do anything.

Next, when people had tell you their experiences that they had when were young. You already know what not to do when you grow up, because someone had already tell you not to do it. Maybe your grandfather, parents, friends, e. t.c. had tell you plethora of their experiences that they had. They tell you does experiences, because they don't want you to commit the same mistake that they did in the past. In addition to, they want you to do better them what they did in their best moment of life.

Furthermore, they want you to do successful in life. One day, you are about to do something wrong, but then you realized that someone that you know did it before, and they had already tell you that it didn't went well. Then you stop and you think what happen to that person that did the same mistake you were about to do. In conclusion, maybe when you were young you did something wrong. You would shared that experiences to your children, grandchildren, and others, because you would not like them to commit the same mistake. Even that someone had already tell you not to do it.

Finally, in my point of view learning the experiences of others is important, because they don't want you to do the same mistake. First, one person that have shared his experiences with me is one of my friends, he had tell plethora of experiences because he dont want me to get in trouble as he used to be when he got the same age that I have.
