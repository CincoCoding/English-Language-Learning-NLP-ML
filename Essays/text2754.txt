Would you like to act like someone else when your not? You should always be yourself nobody should ever tell u how to carry yourself. You ever heard of the quote,"Don't judge a book by its cover?'' I honestly believe in that. I was once a scrawny kid getting bullied cause of the way I carried myself and dressed. I never got the chance to get the shoes I wanted or the clothes so other kids who were on the football team would bully me. But little did they know i was the nicest and honest kid at

Generic_School.

In the year 2015 throughout 2018 I was someone I really wasn't. I was in the streets doing the opposite of what my mother showed me. Robbing people, fighting, breaking curfew, breaking into peoples cars. I was going through it because I was tired of people bullying me, I was tired of people emberrassing me infront of other kids.

By the time I tried to get a job,all they woud do was look at me head to toe and say they arent looking for employees right now even though their was a help wanted sign out front. Even my moms friends would judge me on my looks just because I have tattoos and have a mean mugging face. I may have a bad background but that was me trying to be somebody im not, I was trying to fit in with the bullies, wiith the kids who used to bully me.

Moral of the story is don't let nobody get to you and make you into something your not. I wish I could go back and prevent myself into being someone whom im not. My uncle got caught smuggling narcotics and is praying everyday he gets out. This all happened because he was trying to be someone he wasn't.

To conclude, A couple misedemenors and felonies can ruin your entire life. Don't be someone your not, Be yourself.
