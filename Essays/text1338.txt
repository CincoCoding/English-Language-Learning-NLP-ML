I think that several people make there own decision's then other people about there life because" they might need help on what to do?"for the people that need guidance to know more info.

I belive that the the people that found a way of making there own decision were so confidence that they had to decided on what to do. but if they don't, it would be wise to ask for assistance to make decision with experts so that way they can have in idea of what decison to make. because if they had made there own decision that they had regret that would have been there issue for not making a wise chose. but anyway people who are confidence can make there own choices.

other however the ones that need assistent might not know what to do when they have a decision to make. those people ask for help. they ask for guidance so that they can have more of an idea of what they are going to decide which gives them a more higher opportunity to decide which could led up to a good or bad situation. it all depend's on the person who is determen to decide.

i suggest that both ways all depend on a person because we all have our difffent way's and many can cause a huge impact on people life the more info you know the better you have to understand what path you are taking because new's had spred that people are making wrong decision which led to to be indanger.

some say that making your own decision is your issue while some ask for assistent to know what to do in a situation. which can be good for several people around the world.
