I think i'm going to agree what Churchill had said. Because, if i success so easily, i won't able to understand how hard to earn something. Some people think they are smart and they'd never fail. But me, i thought a different way. I thought that if i fail,i 'll have more experience. For an example, in my country, Vietnam, people always say that failure is the key lead to your success. I have failed many times in my life, but i never give up. I remembered when i was 8, i was really love the egg that my mom made for me. So i asked her how to made that egg, and of course i had broken a lot of eggs. And i also wanted to give up, but, i'm really love the foods that made from egg. So i continued learning how to cook the egg, and now i succeed with the fried egg dish. In my conclusion, i want to say that being a failure isn't a bad thing, because it helps me know that i can do better.
