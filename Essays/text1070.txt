I Think that Technology is a positive thing. Becuase it help's people get there stuff done thru the internet

The internet has become a huge part in our life's becuase we use are phones for every thing. it's good that technonlogy has improved because back in the old days technology was not there but now.

you can order anything online and it will be there less then a week. now and days if people are sick they can use there phones to look up how they can cure themselves. it has also improved because back then people couldn't facetime to see their relatives. but now they can see their family memebers from any forein country.

If need to learn how to cook or bake all you have to do is look it up on google and it will show you pictures,videos.

and also show's other recipes on how to cook other foods. you can mostly do everything oline and it's easy to do. technonlgy has developed a easy way on how to get shuff done with out leaving the house. most people send most of there day in there phone watching videos. socail media has also inproved. a lot of people just post pictures.

Some people like social media because it's like a news paper it tell's you what has been going on in people's life.

it also shows funny videos and new stuff that people have invented. you can also talk and meet new people by texting and facetime. I believe that tecnology has taking over the world because some people can not live without there phone.
