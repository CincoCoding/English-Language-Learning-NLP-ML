kind,caring,nice. Those words explain the meaning of a person if they are trying to be their self. Although some people may think its okay to be yourself in a world where its always trying to change you , nevertheless , some people may think is not okay to be in a world where its trying to always trying to change you into something else because people should express them self how they want to they shouldnt be in a world where its constantly trying to make them into something else and people should live how they wanna live.

For example , people should express them self how they want to be they shouldnt be in a world where its constantly trying to make them into something else. People have all right to be who they wanna be but if you in a world where it is trying to change you that is not a great accomplishment. Clearly people should be who they wanna be.

Therefore , people should live how they wanna live. Everyone picks how they wanna live in a world some people pick to live in a world where people get to pick who they wanna be and some people pick for them self who they wanna be. But its NOT okay to live in a world where everyone picks for you u not making a great accomplishment for yourself. If your making a change for your self you should be living in a world where it doesnt judge you for trying to be something you wanna be and you turn your self around and be come something where everyone want you to be a they call it "great accomplishment" .
