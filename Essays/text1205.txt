It has been said that a positive attitud is the key to success in life.

I'm agree with this statement, I'm one of the persons that think that a good attitude can open many doors to anyone.

Example: If tou are looking for job, and you are talking to the person who is going to give you the job, and you are being with a negative attitude, and being arrogant tha person is going to think more about it.

Example: If your attitude is bein positive, and you are being nice with tha person his going to be nice also, and yuo would have more posibility to get it.

A reason of why you need to be with a positive attitude, is because life is more easy by tha way your main is out of stress, but more important you would be always happy.

And my last oppinion, I defent this position because, year's ago i was with a very negative attitude and always thinks happened to me, and i alwas was like why this is hapening to, and one day i say is enough and i was about to finish with my life and i dont know what happen that from tha day i change my main, when you do think with a good attitude everything is goin to be better.
