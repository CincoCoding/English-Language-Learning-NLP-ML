World is change every second. Each year grow tree. But people cut trees faster.

Some people says to be succesful in our life person need be yourself. But, why?

Be yourself is the best way to be succesful.

But most of people don't know, how be succesful? They think that to have money they will be succesful. For example, peoples try be IT programers, because someone say that they earn more money. But most people don't know, what it is and in this area most people are new. Their don't want work and their work are looks not good. After a couple time, they left this job and they trying somthing else. Only couple of them stay on this area. Another example is students. This year some students will be grated, and they don't come back to school again. Nobody don't ask "Does student want go to school?". And this is one of the reason, why students don't want go to school. But, those years that he was in school, he will be remind.

Most people don't know, what will be after four years. Students go to college which say their parents.

Most of us to survive in this life doing that he or she don't want. Most imigrants come to rich countries because they have money. They learn their native language just to have more money.

One person say "Make your job what you want to do and you wouldn't work, never". We don't think how we can be succesful? And it's make wrong desision. People think that be painter or artist is bad, because they don't have much more money. This mind is wrong. Artists are be not bad because they live by yourself.

To find yourself is hard because it take time and other people influens to other people. But when person find yourself his or her life will be happy.

Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, "To be yourself in world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"

I agree, because yourself it's make life better.
