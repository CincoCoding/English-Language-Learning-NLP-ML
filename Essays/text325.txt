It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people agree with this statement. In my opinion, first impressions are always wrong, and they are possible to change. I have several reasons for my opinion.

The first reason why I dissagree with this statement is because we can not judge on other people from the first sight. Meeting someone and talking to them dose not mean that you know them yet. Some people treat others with different way. For example, if you are close to me and we know each other for long time, I will treat you different than a person who I just met.

The second reason why I dissagree with this statment is because we do not know what other people going through. If you met a person for the first time and this person was rude or aggressive, there should be a reason for this behaviour. Maybe the person had a bad day or perhaps he is going through rough situations. You should think about what you are going to do if you were in the same position. That is why I dissagree with the statement.

In conclusion, I'm against the statement that says the first impressions are almost impossible to change because we should know the person well before we think about any impression. In addition, everything could change and nothing stays the same.
