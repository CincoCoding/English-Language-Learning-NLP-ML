The British naturalist and John Lubbock wrote.

Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.'Do we choose our own character traits ,or is our character formed by influences beyond our control.

Although some people think that character is formed for other persons that are around them and that their character is always going to be formed for people around them but character is formed by the way of your own emotions that shows how you feel how you are, other people says that if they don't be like other people want to they be they feel out of the group in that moment some people starts to hate their self, but what other people do is they ignore what people says about them as they don't hear anything and never give up.

Other people think that if they don't change their character they are going to success in their life and that they are obligate to change for they future and when they change they start to feel bad because they change something better than what they get and when other people ask them for what they change they says that for be an adult they have to be like one but what is a adult is a is a person that looks death and is always mad with other people or they say that the character is formed from the moment they born and that hey can not do anything about it .

In my conclusion, We choose our own character and it's doesn't have nothing with others person ,we choose how we wanna be and how we feel better with our self...
