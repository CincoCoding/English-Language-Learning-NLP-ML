Introduction: technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. people can check out books, shop and play game without speaking to another person.

Reason:

I think the people cant do nothing without help because is necessary to have help from others. people who dont us technology I think is negative because without technology the people can do nothing for example they cant to have contact with other or for a jobs. I believe the people who use the technology can to be positive because can do anything, how have a job or the technology can go to be negative to because somebody use the technology, how in her house, for example; the child can cause a problem with they eyes, or another thing more.

I think people cant do nothing without help of other, because is necessary to have help from others, or help of the technology. The technology can help at the people for a job, but the technology can effect to the family to, for example; at the child, to use technology is good, but I think we can put a limit for her effect to have. The effect have the technology with the family is can cause a problem with other or for a job, because someone use the technology.

I think without technology people dont dont can to have a job because somebody use technology for therby the technology, so I can to be positive, Howeve the technology have effect at the people and help at the people with a job, and for to have contanct to with another people.
