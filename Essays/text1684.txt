The misnister of

Wilnston churchill, he say that success in life or anyother things, theres a failure and don't lose enthusiasm because of that litlle things or because you fail one time in your try.

I agree with the minister churchill say because succsee it's a way to improve your skills or be betther in what you did and you try to not haves more make mistakes annymore, success can have failure but also you can lern for them, and learn how to rersolve your pronlemsand see how far you can go by trying, how you can have more expiriense by traying and traying again and again, no making mistakes annymore so the next time you don't have the same mistakes or pronblems because you larn about it.

I think with success you can learn a lot of experiance in your life, because with your failure you learn about it, because if you leave it like that you not trying and you are not exploing your self, so if you exploit your self you can see how far you can go to resolve the problems or the mistake you have.

So if you explod your self trying more and more you can maybe resolve the problem or see how far you can go to find a solution, the thing is if you keep trying your best in somthing you don't know exacly what it is or how to resolve it in many times you can find a solution and fix it.

failure is not you are not going to resolve it because if you are doing your best but you keep failure is becuase you need to find the problem you are not seeing, to resolve it failuture is not because is not working success is because you didn't find the solution at your problem.

For my conclusion for success you have to pass for a lot of problems and mistakes so you can find a solution for it, in your life if you don't explow your self you won't know what was the problem to that but if you explow your self you can find the solution and also learn from that, trying hard and hard moust of the times you can find a solution for evryting and that is how you also you can help others with they problems like when they say two heads is better then one.
