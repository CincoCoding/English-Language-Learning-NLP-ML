Dear : Principal

I think that would be a great idea if the you let the student to do community service , because if they do that the street were clean, they go to put more attention helping others person . i mean i know other person doesn't like to clean but i know that we cant make the other people to change ,ho know if they start helping us to like not throwing the trash on the streets. it's not necessary clean the hold day but like 3h that would be great. i know we cant do that i only need to know if you agree or disagree with me. EX: painting the sidewalk cleaning the beaches cleaning the street school helping people that really need are help like paralytic, oldest, veterans persons.
