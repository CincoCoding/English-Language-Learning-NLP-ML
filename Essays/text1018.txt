Technology has had such positive impact in the world. Know a days people dont have to do much if they want to food all they have to do is take out there phones, some people find a problem with that and i just cant understand why. If something is making a impact on your life making a lot of things easier to do and have fun while you doing it. Back in the day if I ever wanted food i would have to get on my phone call a place and wait for it to driver, know I can order what ever i wanted and can track the driver to see where there at.

Sometimes technology doesnt help in everyday things. It is very important tho that people still know how to do things without technology to because it will come in handy sometimes. Older people have a such a bad thing for technology because they think, every kid is brain washed and just stays on it all the time. Kids these days kinda know how to do both like its not every day i get to type on a computer I'm usually just writing stuff on paper.

Technology has come a very long way. It has its perks and its down side,but we can all agree that its made life easier. Sometimes people abuse it and its ok because you can still live with out technology.
