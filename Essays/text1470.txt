I think that imagination is not more important then knowledge, so I disagree with this statement that Albert Einstein made. It know for a fact that I use knowledge more than imagination.

Some reasons why i disagree are if you don't know anything you cant imagine anything. You might be asking your self why? But the simple answer is that if you don't know anything, you also won't know what to imagine. Without knowledge you can't imagine and create or do stuff.

Next reason is that, I think knowledge counts as experience and experience could save you from getting hurt or killed. I know that if I got burned because I sipped from o mug full of hot coffee, I would not sip from it again until it cools down because I have experienced the burn.

My last reason is that, sometimes when i use my imagination, I use it to create or do something and make it creative. But you can't make it creative if you dont know what creative you are looking for. One example is when i had to make my name out of macaroni and cheese.

That was my reasons and what I think, what do you think? In conclusion I disagree because its just obvious to me that knowledge is more important than imagination. Do you agree or disagre with me?
