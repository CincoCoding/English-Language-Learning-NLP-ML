I am agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson to always keep tryaing to do best . My greatest acomplishment were to be student of the month in my school . I always try to be successful in my classes. Maybe best of the class but if you can trying yo can be one of then. Alson you can make a goal for the year to get an A on your Geometry classs. I always try to compete with my friends who can get the best note on my exam.

My cousin is the only one that gets the best grade at home. she study alots and always gets very good grade. I admire her because English is not her first lenguaje and her mom is so proud of her . One day I want to be like her so can my family feels proud of me.

The greates thing that i want to is graduate for that i have to pass my clases and exams .For that I have to pass my others SOL and others elective classes that I have this year. the most dificult class that I have next semester will be Earthscience but I will pass that class and the SOL and i feel like i can do it.

Finally this are resons why i am agree Ralph Waldo on constantly try to make you greatest acomplishment on his life .I want to do the same in my life too. This are some reasons why i was agree. Always Try and never give up that you always can do greatest acomplishments on your life you only have try hard and you will success.
