Technology is good for many stuff. For example, technology is good for research, homework or otherstuff. But, they their is a negative effects on people's lives. Technology can be use for bad stuff like in internet, researching bad stuff in the website. But like I said technology is good for many stuff

Technology is good for research because when your doing a project or study for test. But you dont know anything you just research in the website. Also good for your homework, you can find the answer or get informtion rewrite on your word. But, technology has negative effects on people's lives.

(I was talking a the computer).

Technology is good for play game. For example, I have a Playstation Four and so many video game. I play all day not get bored. But then, much too technology can cost your eye to get hurt or loose your eye sight. Their a other thing is bad for us as a teen. We waste so much time on video game rather spend time on doing our homework,prove writing skill, reading.

technology (phone) is good for communication with other people in fairy away places. For example, My family live in Generic_City, but my aunt and unlce live in Generic_City. But we use a phone to call them if their fine and we talk them about our life. Even tho were fary away them we still communicat with them.
