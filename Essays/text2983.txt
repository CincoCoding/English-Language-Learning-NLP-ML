If you where a high schooler would you know what you would want you'er career to be ? Some say that students are expected to know to the career that they want to have so that they take specific class for that career. So that it could help them acive or get closer to the career that they want.

All though some say that high schools students should not be expected to know what specifice career they want. Frist peopel tented to chang over time so somthing that you might have liked three years ago you might not like that much anymore. Second you cant really telll if you like somthing intell you try it. Lets say that Generic_Name has wanted to be a teacher her whole life but then she gets the job and finds out that she is not that happy with her job and that she should have tryed other class in high school. Finaly most student dont really think about thier careers intill the last two years of high school.

actuily all students should know what they want thier career to be by the time they are in high school. Frist if student where to know what they want there career to be they could take specific class for that career. By students not having to take other class that they dont need it would help them focuse more because they whouldnt have to worry about having to take or study for a test in a class that they dont need. Finally if a student was to be taking class that he/she wants they would show up to class more because they would be intersteded.

Thats why I belive that students should know what career they want when they get into high school. Because it would help them out and even make thier life esay. Even if that idea was to chang but it all ways good to have a goal so that you can acive it.
