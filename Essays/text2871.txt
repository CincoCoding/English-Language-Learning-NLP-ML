John Lubbock wrote one's "your character will be what you yourself choose to make it." I believe that we can choose our own character traits.

Everyone is different we all have distinguishing quality's, put it this way if your an apple and your around mangos every day, is not goint to be different even if they trying to make you a mango your still going to be a aplee.

Going back to what John Lubbock wrote, "Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."

i belive this prompt is right we can choose our own character traits.

We can be happy, sad, angry, or crazy. People are not going to tell us when we can or can't do.

I dont like when people tell me staff for example, I dont like when people are trying to make me something im not. I can choose what i want to be. This is why i belive that we can choose our own character traits.
