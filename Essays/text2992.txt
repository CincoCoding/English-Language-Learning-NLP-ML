Do you think school's should extend the school hours? Well, I disagree. First, student would not concentrate in school if they got out an hour and a half late. Some student's may need time to do homework, go places that take a long time, or just make up time to study. If schools were to add more time the students would not get enough sleep because they stayed up late studying for a quiz, test, or just homework causing the students or the other classmates to sleep during classes

Second, it would affect the mental health of the students. Making them stress out over knowing that they would have to wake up early and be dismissed late.

Third, the education time of some student's may be cut short. This may happen when some student's are in a sport or they just need to leave school early. Student's who participate in a sport may have to leave class early to go practice for an up coming game making them miss half and hour or more of education.
