If someone wants to grow more as a person, they will have to try different things. I believe that Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. To grow more as a person people have to try different things because the most things they do the more experience they get. If a person mastered something already he will feel that he know everything but the true is that he only know whay he mastered, but if a pereson try different thing he would get more experience that can be use in the future.

an example of this is Pique. He is a famous soccer player. he get pay a lot of money, but to grow more as a person. he also become a busines man. Now Pique have a lot of companies that work for him. he also created his own Tennis league in Spainh. Pique also support a fundation that his wife created to help kids in Colombia.

Other example is one of my uncles from Generic_City. his mane is Generic_Name. He study to be a teacher. He was very happy with his work, but to grow more and get more knowledge he go back to college to study to become a doctor. Now he feel like he know more and that he have grow more as a person.

I also like to thing that I'm a example of this. I always try to do my best to leard different sports. I'm a really good soccer player, but I prefere to try others sports. I play a different sport everyday because I feel that this will help me to become a better player and will give me the experience to grow more as a athlete. I also like to to study a lot for the classes that I'm having problems because I get more knowledge about different topics and make me grow more as a student

People can still growing when they mastered something. An example of this is Leonel Messi. he is a soccer. he has play soccer all his life's. He always was getting better and better every year. he never play other sport in his life's. Now he is considere one of the best player in the world. He grow as a person by doing what he already mastered.

people have to do different things in their life's if they want to grow as a person because if they think they are the best is a lie. They are the best in what they mastered, but they don't have any type of knowledge in other thing. In conclution if someone wants to grow more as a person. He will has to try different things to get more experience and more knowledge.
