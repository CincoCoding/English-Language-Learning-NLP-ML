It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to the success in life, I'm totally agree in this case, because as we are growing up, we are thinking in just positive things. when we are kids, we start thinking in what we want to be when we grow up, then we turn to adolescent and we start thinking in what university we want to go, and finally when we turn to the age of adult we start thinking in what we gonna do to give a better future to ours children.

First, when we where kinds we have only positive attitude,we only think in positive things as what we want to wen we grow up, for example: some kinds said theta they want to doctors,astronauts, and teachers; some kids said that they want to be doctors because, they want to save lives,

and find the priest for the cancer, some kids said that they want to be a astronauts because, they that to go to the moon, some kids said that they want to be teachers because, they want to teach others kind something that they know and they know is gonna be helpful for them in life.

Second, when we turn to the ages of adolescent, we start thinking in our graduation of high school and what university we want to go that is better for us, we think in positive thing that can can be better in our lives, something positive so we can have a better future and not be in gangs or things like that that can cost our lives, In my opinion positive attitude in can help you to find find a better way in your lives to find what you really want to be, and just that it can help you to find good friends and good works, because your attitude It's what makes a better person.

Finally, when we turn to the age of adult we start thinking in what we gonna do to gives a better future to ours children. when we turn to adults and we have kids we start thinking is positive things that can help to our kids in there future, if we have a positive attitude everything that we do for ours kids It's gonna be all right, because we know that what we are doing is positive and not negative, but is we do things with a negative attitude we know that ours kids are gonna get things wrong and then they gonna a have a negative attitude as we teach them in home, thats why we have to teach then just positive attitude.

In conclusion,

positive attitude is the key to success in life, because positive attitude it can help you to find a better life, makes good friends, find a great job, and it can help you to gives a better future to ours kids, positive attitude is the key to keep going forward and have a better life.
