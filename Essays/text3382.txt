As students are getting involved in activities and extracurricular activities and get better in their educational experiences and others students are having short time to do their homework and assigments, so this decision should be left to students and families and sometimes school should control.

Some students already know what they want for their future life and doing this activities they are enriching their educational experiences and getting ready for what they want to do for their future, so in this possition shools should not control this envolment on this activites instead they have bad grades, missing classes or being absent to school. for example my friend Generic_Name likes technology and he is taking an academic class and to take that class he needs to go to another school but luckly his main school gives him the opportunty to take him to the another school, and he already know that this class will help him on his career and his taking care of his grades and at the same time taking care about his academic class.

Now there are other students that are doing this activiteis and they are nnot totaly about what they are doing and they are forgetting about their shool. So if this is happenning is when schools shouold control students envolment in this activities because they will have bad grades on their classes and will miss school year and this will afect thier careers. for example , I do not kniw what I really want for my future and I am getting involved in many activities at school but I am not forgettimg about my assigments for school and I do not have basd grades.

In conclusion there could be reasons when schools should or should not control about students involment in this extracurricular activities because sometimes they will have question aboout something so school may help to answer their questions.
