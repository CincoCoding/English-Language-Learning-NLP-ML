Society said that the first impression are almost imposible to change. But, I am totally disagree with that because there many people in this world that when they go to their first interview they don'tknow how to dress up for a interview and they may not have have someone to show or teach them how to act, how dress up or how important is to be on time when they have interviews or when they're going to meet someone important. It could be a girl or a boy that they're interesting on and their first impression may not be how his/her boss want it to be.

But if they're really interesting on that boy or girl who want the job or went to meet them they may give them a second chance to make their really good impression and that man/woman that like or want to obtain or to meet they will work really hard to get what they want ,they will search or obtain imformation on how to be presentable or to act in their interviews or when you're meeting someone you are interesting on. For example,If i want a job that is really flexible and easy and that's my first time getting a job and I am don't no nothing about how to be dress up, how to act infront of your future boss or future or girlfriend/boyfriend and how important is to be o time because it's how it works,If you're late to an interview or a place when you will going to meet with that girl/boy they will left or they may not interview you. However, If explain them what happend at the first date or interview that i wasn't presentable or on time they may gave me a second chance to do it and that's where I'm going to be at least 10 0r 20 minutes before on that interview or on that date that they gave me and be presentable and known how to act infront of them. They will like it and there you will gave them a second impression and they will gave you that job or you will have the chance to meet more that gir/boy that you like really bad. In conclusion,there is always a second chance to show or gave people a second impression that they may not believe that you can do it.

Finally, people can not judge people at the first time,they may gave them a second chance or explain them how to do it an that way they can be successful in life and they can make you happy if you get love each other.
