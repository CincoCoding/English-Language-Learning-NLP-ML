Dear: Mr Generic_Name

Hi! Mister Generic_Name i'm writing this for you about never to be idle the peolpe who don'nm like to do nothing people that they are lazy , this it's important that the peolple that are lazy they should learn abot that like What they can do for don't be lazy ? What are the disadvantage and others benefit that could help them.

This position take care to all the people that don't like to do nothing with specifics ways some pelople have differents things that could be like lazy like , Many students are lazy to do their homework people that are lazy to work and they have to do it because it's necesssary for our life , Also the peolpe who have that study in university they like more go to a party people like that only want go to places that are funny or sleep the whole day in many countries people still with that the people who have a dream in their lifes and not strive to do it now who have opportunities that are young can strive for they want for their lifes in their futures , about the information that we can find it in Google about this topic also is a procedure that they can take to have energy I think also could be anemia and they could eat well .

Anothers examples that can help to people that should know them: Can be idle their whole life if they don't take care what they have or how they be : In centro America many cases are similar or could be like this , Also the children growing only playing with what they like example : soccer , video games , car , playing with their computers , etc.

How I think it's necessary that the others peolpe help to them to bring ideas what they need to do for don't be idle can take a long time to improve and have new personality and think different.... Some offices can help them to improve there are many ways to leave of that , In specific the women who are idle in cases thar have children and husband have to leave of that case because many women have to do it all of their work at home if they have their own work already it's other case.

Sincerely :
