I think reading would be a enjoyable educational activity because you might find a book very intresting to you and it will also help your brain better at reading. reading is fun and also educational but it all depends on the person because some people might not like reading they could like reading when they are adults. and the best thing about reading you can do it anywhere like at school,friends house,airport ext. some people are into alot of different genre's like comedy,or horror,drama,ext. i like reading diary of a wimpy kid,and comic's my favorite was diary of a wimpy kid dog days it was about a kid named greg getting his first dog and not knowing how hard it is to take care of it.

if you don't like reading alone their are some things called bookclubs if you don't know what they are they are a group of people friends,family ext and they read the same book as you and talk about it they tell predictions,summarys, if you are wondering where the bookclubs could be located in librarys or you can make your own wiyh your friends or family. and this is what i thinks is a enjoyable educational activity.
