should the school extend the school day two hours and four-day a week?

people have different opinion about being ten hours in the school day. some people think it is a good idea for their kids to be ten hours at the school day. However, I believe that being ten hours in the school day it is not a good idea, because it dose not help for the energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid.

First, being ten hours in the school day dose not help in the energy and the resources; Because we spend the same amount of time at the school, But instead of spending an eight hours a day in five-day a week we will spend ten hours a day in four-day a week. so we are going to spend the same amount of energy in both.

Second, everyone's brain needs to a break. If we spent ten hours of our day at the school we are not going to be having that much time to live our lives, do our work and see our family. everyone needs to relax and sleep enough during the day to focus more and do more good at school.

Finally, ten hours is too much for a kid to spend in a day at the school. kids will dislike going to school. they will get tired. for example when my sister stay a little longer after school for extra work, she comes back home so tired, not talking to anyone and doing noting, because she is tired of being a little bit longer at the school.

In conclusion, as you have read. extend the school day two hours a day in four-day a week is not a good idea because it dose not help to conserve energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid. so what we can do is not extend the school day two hours a day, so all the kids can do good at the school, focus more and live their life happy.
