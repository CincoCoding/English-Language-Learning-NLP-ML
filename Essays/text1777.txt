Dear: Generic_Name

I Understand that you are concidering the idea to work in group. I appreciate what are you trying to do and I agree with, for two reasons I think working in group can give you a lot of benefits because you can help each other, so you can do a better job and, also you can share differents ideas with your parners.

The first reason is that you can do a better job working in group. For example when I am working in group in my job I ask my parners to check my work to make sure I am doing a good job.

additianally, you can share different ideas with your parners or also, you can share your toys that you usually use for work. For example when I am working in group with my class I always ask my friends if I can use their stuf.

Therefore I strongly believe that working in group give you a lot of benefits. which I allow with positive for two reasons. you can do a better job helping each other and, also you can share your ideas with your parners. thank for your time.

sencerly:
