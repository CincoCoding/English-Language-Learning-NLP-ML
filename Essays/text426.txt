Community, state, national parks provide a wide variety of interesting activities. I will write about an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors. I will use specific details and examples, to explaing why someone might find that activity enjoyable.

For my opinion i think i will like to have a community, state, national park that has two fields. One basketball field with soccer goals at the botton of the basketball hoot. Then last but not least a tennis court. That would be cool.

Then i will want the parks/play ground, to be split in two. One small play ground for little childrens under 9 years old.

And then the other one will be for kids above 10 years old.

Now i will describe what will i want to look like or have on the babies' play ground from a 2/3 year old kid to 9.

kids and parents will like to have tiny slides of a hight of 3 or 4 feet tall and have sings that are special for babeis'. Then little benches were they can sit with there parents. After that i will like does little horses made of plastic or metal, that you can move back and forth.

Then now i will tell you and describe you how can kids will love kids to have on the other park or play ground from kids from 10 and above.

So maybe kids will love to have two fields' because maybe they like to play soccer or basketball and tennis so one of them will be a basketball field with small soccer goals at the botton of the basketball hoot because a lot of kids like soccer and basketball. Then the other field will be a tennis field. What kids will love too is have to courts on one field too. Then for the slide i want four of the to have a hight about 6 or 7 feet tall and two with curls and the other two, just normal.

Then the other biggest ones will be of a high of 10 feet tall and i will promise you that kids will love it!

So they don't get bord and say; this is boring. This is for little kids, i don't like it!.

So this is what i think that chlidrens will like to play on. That is all i wanted to say.
