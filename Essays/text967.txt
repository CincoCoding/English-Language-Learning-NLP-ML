I disagree with Thomas Jefferson because you need to be inactive sometimes to lay back and relax. If you're always up amd doing something then you wont really have much rest. You can be active and get stuff done but also kick back sometimes andrecharge your energy.

Im not saying that you shouldnt do you're work but dont forget to do that work you need to get energy. Another reason is if youre sick and cant move around so you dont have to do anything then as well. There are many excuses for you not to do something.

You should do stuff tho like the important things you need done. For instance go to a doctors appointment or get groceriec. Just because you dont have to do something all the time doesnt mean you shouldnt move from being an idle.

You should never be an idle tho. You should always get up and get an excersise or cardio because laying down and not doing anything can also cause sickness in your body that you dont want. Thats what i think of this prompt and those are the reasons i give.
