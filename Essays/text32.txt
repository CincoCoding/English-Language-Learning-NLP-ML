Some people may think that positive attitude is not the key to success in life, but I disagree with them because I feel like now days are not the same like it used to be, and I think its a big issue that we have today in our world.

People just wanna finish their jobs very fast, and they wanna get where their going really fast,

and that leads to not have a good attitude with others, one of the first reasons is you can get to your dream job, for example if your positive with others they can like you or offer you a deal that's going to change your life for ever, and they may say that your a great person, and they might offer you to come and work in their company or work in a really great passion.

Another reason is you can make someones day or make them happy, for example their having a really bad day and you come and talk to them with a positive attitude, and maybe your going to make them really happy and also that can effect on others if you make them happy they can make others people happy also.

One last reason is Communication, for example by having a positive attitude you can communicate with others, and you can have a good relationship with them and maybe be really good friends.

In conclusion for all theses reasons i think positive attitude is the key to your success.
