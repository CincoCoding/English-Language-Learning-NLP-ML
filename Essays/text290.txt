I remember when i was in my country my uncle have a little store and he was trying to grow but he try for much time but he see that his store looks sad poor so he close the store and was asking for help and just like 5 or 4 people help him and at the pass of the year we see him building a good house he grow inmediatly and people get surprised by him because a lot of people din't not beleave of him so people get mad of him because only because he grow and people don't want to other grow. the wheter is that you will never grow. i am agree that you can grow with what you have already my firs reason is that people can grow working hard like my uncle did because my uncle did work hard and that store is there because him. my second reason is work together look there are many games in this world but some of them dont like to work together so is a game called Pug mobile and the other game is Residential of evil and those game work together and they are getting good thing and that how every one need to do to grow my third reason is to be easy going to to be sad because you dont have nothing that how the biggest company start with nothing so that how people have to thing to be ungry to dream and if you take that seriously you will be someone in this life so work hard and never give up whem you fall stand up is no matter how many time you fall that inportant thing is to never give up some people may say look at that person he or she is crasy if that dont work just keep trying and you will see you grow.
