life is to much fun and joy and happines we just need to know how to organize it to make it easer, so we can be better as we can.

I do agree with Emirson's statement because before we do something we have to finish what we have in our hand, so we can go to next step, like we can't go to next flore without going into stairs.

to be better person as you can you have to be orzanize your stuff, so you can make it perfect because you have enough time to do what you got in your hand and before you start your day you should know what to do before you go out from bed.

without organize you will see everything hard and impossible to finish, like in school when you have all work from all other classes and you see them all facing your eyes, you will do not doing any homework.

To make life easer with happines you better organize it and make your life better as you can, or you will never grow up.
