The skill i have learned is playing fortnite, i started playing the game in 6th grade because some of my friends told me to play it and i was like ''ok i guess'' so then i downloaded the game. And i sent friend requests to my friends from school, when i playing with them i was the only one who just started.

I would just keep dying because i didn't know how to play, so what we would do we would hide the whole game and wait to the vary end to try to win. Then as time went by they added creative and creative was your own world you can join and do whatever you want, you could buildfight your friends or make teams or even do free for all.

And as time went by again i was getting better and told myself i want be really good at the game, so and i looked in youtube and it gave me so much information. I learned so much new things that i would practice in creative to try to learn them.

I would mostly look in youtube on how to do retakes, retakes are ways to try to get above a person without getting shot at. It would be really helpful but then my skill as a player was not getting better, because the only thing i would practice is build the right stuff. I would not be good ar editing or aiming, because i would never practice it. It took time to stay above the meta i just needed to find the right balance for all 3 major componets in the game.

Then people discovers new things like how to win fights and how to make smart moves and smart edits that can win you the game. what im just lacking as a player is making the smart dicisions, like when to rush a player and when to not but in my opinion there is always something to learn overall fortnite is one of my skills that took me time to learn.
