Dear principal,

I think that every students should perform and they should be required to perform community service. For example some children and others clean up litter.

But there are so many children who do not want to help other to get the job done .

The principal need to tell other to get the community clean. Everyone need to take position on the required to perform community service. we need to keep our community clean. Everybody need to be part of the job. I think every one should know that we need thing clean
