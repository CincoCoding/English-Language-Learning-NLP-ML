Dear principal

I think is great idea that the student must B average to participate in sports because it would help student there grades and benefit or learn more. some many kids all the world want to be sport famous player. and another reason is that they have to do their homework , study for their test and participate in class so that can play any activities they want or dream about that they will be come one day. getting B or A average in every day i would be awesome because some o]f the student don't believe that they can do they work and get good grand to they can play the sport the like to be come on day.

always believe in your self no matter what other thing about. once again i love

that idea !!!!.
