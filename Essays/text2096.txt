Hey my name is Generic_Name, and today im here at Generic_School talking with some of the students about life threating situtions where you have to take actions. let's say there was a lockdown in your school and the bad guy was at your classroom and he was banging on the door, and broke the glass window to unlock the classroom door now he found his way in! now the best thing to do is grab anything like books,desks,chairs anything you can throw at him.

Now lets talk about fire drills the best thing to do is not panic, you just got to act fast and think smart your main priorty is for you and your friends to get out the building safely. follow your teacher during the fire, cover your mouth with your shirt or sweater dont inhale the smoke thats how you pass out from the smoke.

Now the last thing im gonna go over with these 5 graders is what to do when an earth qauke is happening, the first thing u wanna do is get underneath or sink something stable tuck and duck your head. dont go under something that can fall on you that could be very risky and dangerous.
