I desagree whit this statement, because some people can change, how people look at them and given a good impression again, for example if the person dirend do well the first time, he would do better the second time, it is like given a second opportunity, second example is that the person who you are given the opportunity to change, is not doint nothing to change it, is better to not give them a second chanse.

For me the first impression is not to much important, because that firt impression can change at any time, and the the one how you diren t give him a second change, cand be better tha the firt one my experience whas one day i have do a poster, and my was ugly when the teacher say that whe have to do other poster in a group and nobody whant to join my group, and i finishet by myselft wen te teacher calify the poster, may whas te best one in the class.
