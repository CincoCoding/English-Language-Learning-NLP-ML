I'm agree because your first impression it will be the one that represent who you are and it will show your personality, and the people will judge you becauseyour aparience and your actitude, for example, when i was looking for a jod at chipotles restaurant for the first time, they where looking at me strange like i was a bad person or a criminal.

The next day i went to popeye's restaurant with different type of clothes, and they didn't look at me in a strange way, and that was because i was dressing properly, and because my friend tell me to dress better because in the first time when i went to chipotle i was dressing as a bad guy and that make me look inapropiate and i did get the job.

After that i went to chipotle restaruant just for fun to prove if my friend was right and he was, the people from chipotle didn't look at me in a strange way as the first time, i think it's because they didn't remember me but when the manager comes he said, "hoo hellow you're back," then he leave.

The manager was the only person who remembers me and he did not change his opinion about me, i didn't care because by that time i did get the job at popeyes so i decide to leave out of there.

In conclution that day i learn that the first impresion metter and it could affect in your life.
