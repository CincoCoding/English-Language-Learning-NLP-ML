I'm an 8th grader and I would like to shared somethings the I would like to accomplish in the futere. My firs thing the I would like to accomplish in the future is to gradute from Hight school and Collage because many benifts if you graduated frome Higth school and Collage you can have a better job like being a nurse and a lawyer and many diffrents types of jobs and you can be a professional worker. But you have to work hard a school dont get introuble at school and not have a bad record so you can accomplish to graduated from Hight school and Collage .In my opinion is worth it be in school for seven hours to pay atention in school cause it will help a lot in your future .The second thing I would like to accomplish is to learn French because that's one of the lenguage I'm intersted on because I like French culture and I feel that French is an easy lenguage to learn because its similar to Spanish and I would like to have the opportunity to know three lenguages (Spanish,Inglesh and, French) and if you know more than one lenguage you can help another people at school and you can also get paid more on your Job .The third thing the I really want to accomplish is to help my parents when I'm older I really want to do this have been with me all the time ,they are been such a good perents I know the they probably wont need my help but I really want to accomplish this goal for many other reasons one of them is because this is coming out of my heart. I ask god to let give them the opportunity to see me and my brother grow and make them proud once againg. The last thing the I would to accomplish is to help the shelters where all the immigrant people are because they are looking for a better future for there family because sometimes there life is in risk and they dont want there family lifes in risk so thats why they risk their life to come to this country.
