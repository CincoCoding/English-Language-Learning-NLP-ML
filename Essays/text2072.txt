Students use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes.

The students we should to consider for what they permit us use our cell phone in the class, and they give us the opportunity and don't spend our time and others things and we should focus in our work.

Many student's when the teacher said you gays can use your phone in the class for search information or some work sometimes that we do is play video games, or see Facebook, Instagram or something else and we don't focus in that the teacher said in the classroom, and spend our time and things that affect us.

For example i know a person when i was in my country when we are in the class the teacher said search information in internet that story of this person or when we was in math class, uses our phone for the calculator but there was one girl that she never do that the teacher say and she start to see Facebook and send messages to his friend that are in the same class and that affect the persons who her is message sometimes there is students that they absolutely do that the teacher say or the school and that case, is really good idea use the cell phone cause help us in the class or to have more information about something that we want to know for example in my case i am a person that don't have too much time in this country, and sometimes when i am reading in my English class and find one word or sentence what i dont know what is that means i need search information about that for understand what am doing, is the same in my math class too much times i dont know how traduce symbols and need use my phone for that i think of that way is very good, school permit us use our cell phone too can be the best way for learn more things and makes our work in the way that the students likes also can be more helpful for the student's and also for the teacher's.

I think all depends of the student, use cell phone in class can affect or also can be good idea for learn in the school the school give us the opportunity, that use our phone we should that feel grateful for the opportunity and uses the phone for the work not for other things what can do that our grades come down.
