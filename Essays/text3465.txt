There is a debate abou to take a musica, a drama, or arts claas, should students need to take a electives classes. Some people believe students need to take a music, a drama, or art classes. I believe students need to take electives classes , so students can choose the classes they need , students have more oportunity to choose classes they like, and they can choose the classes with more opportunity for get more credit. Finally students can choose the claases they need to graduate.

First reason, is students can choose the classes they need , so they can have more oportunity to choose the classes they need for get the diploma, they can choose the classes for get more credit, this is a good idea students can choose a electives classes so tehy can talk with the teachers to choose classes tehy need to graduated. Many others students do not like music or drama claases, students have oportunity if they can choose electives classes so they can have few classes, they can have more time after school if they have a job.

Second reason, is students have more oportunity to choose classes tehy like, many others students doesn't like arts or drama classes, in my opinion this is a good idea students can choose classes they like, this help students to work in classes they like and have a good grades.

Last reason, students can choose classes with more oportunity, students can choose classes can help then to get credit for the diploma, students can talk witg teachers they can help then to get claases they need, this is a oportunity to students they work after school, this can help many students to get a good grades and pass all they classes.

In conclusion, this argument can help students to choose classes that can help then to pass the grade or maybe to graduated, this have many oportunity to choose electives classes, in my opinion i dont like drama and arts classes.
