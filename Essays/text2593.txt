I agree to this beacase students like us always have to got to shcool evreyday of the week and somtimes students get stressed out beacause evreyday we have to got to shcool so it should be better if they extend the shcool time to shorter time or half way. In my opinion it hink that 3:15 is to much of our day so i think that we should make the shcool time shorter. I think it will be the best thing for evreybody because somtimes people have to do thing at home . Sometime si just to late to do them beacasue at 3:15 is already getting dark so i think it shuld be best for all of us if we should get out half time. It will better evreyone beacause evreyone will have time to doanytging that they have to do at home. The last thing i see is that other shcools get to get out more early that us and what i think is that is mot fair they come out early and we dont. But somtime we should have more time out of shcool because when i go home i have things to do.
