It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. I agree with statement because having a positive attitude led to great success and great oppurtunity to do something that you would love, or admire.

With a positive attitude you could do more in life than a person with a bad attitude. For example, a person with a bad attitude trying to get a job as a model but gets mad over how the clothes looks on them or how the photos of them came out. Getting frustrated, or angry won't led to great success that would just make the sitution worser because modeling is a strict job and they have limited time . They can't deal with bad attitude, so you can't success with that job by being anoyed by something that you disagree on . With a positive attitude you could success with modeling because you don't have problems with nothing ,as least you had an oppurtunity to get the job.

Positive attitude led to great success like going to college, getting a good paying job, being respect by others. No one like a disrespecful person by being disrespectful you can't success in life. It's going to be diffucult but as least try be kind to others. People with positive attitude won't have a diffuclt time becuasuse there always kind and respectful to others.

I agree with statement positive attitude is the key to success in life. For example, if i was a hiring someone to work as a model and there two persons try to get the job but i need only one person i would see who haves a positive attitude i woundn't pick someone that don't have respect for others.
