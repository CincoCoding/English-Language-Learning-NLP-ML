In my experiences be disagree with this statement because everybody have different personalitie, The person have one day bad, and the persona change.

however the first impressions can be change, Everybody have different personalitie becuase the people make much caracterist tha see different for example a person can have much cualidad that other people don't have, Also do not always other person have that be yourself.

The person have one day bad becuase something the people in the school can have stressful for example when have so much homework during in class , also the person in the job is possible that have problem for example the other person can cause conflict and making is mad.

However the people change becuase they can have a good expression of a manner that your attitude can be esplendi,

for example no every person have bad comportamient.

In conclusion every one can be different personalitie and not is imposible change our impressions have that be we yourself.
