Im not agree to the schools districts programs for the students to finish their diploma in tree years because it is not enough time in three years then than four years and the students going to study to hard. in the summer and in the evenings the students brain is going to get tire they can not going ta have break they can not going to have the important courses of elective class can be force for the students. however if they finish in tree years the advantage is finish more faster but than can not help to the students also they going to do hard work to study in the summer and evening .

I thing that finish high school in tree years is not a good idea because is better to have the time necessary four years is important is more time.

.

second is if the students finish the school in tree years the students they has to having must to work hard. in the summer and in the evening i thing that the students can be get very tire it is good to have the time and is get more focus before got the university.

it is better to study more and thing what route do you want to go and take the necessary time.

for the student is help more because four years is more time then. Thant tree years and they can no be frosted for then and they can have more free time to do the personals things.

it is better before go to the university and work force because is more time to prepare the students having to focus more on learned more things is good to now more before take the time it is important for the students that four years in the school is going to help for the students in the future for what carers they going to be doing.
