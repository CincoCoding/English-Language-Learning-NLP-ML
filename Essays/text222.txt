Winston Churchill once said that "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." this means that if people fail they should get back up and try again and if they fail once more to never give up. Some people think that if you fail you should just give up right then and there. some people say that if they give up when they fail they should get up and try again and never loss hope, to determined, and to dedicate on what they are trying to achieve.

Everyone person fails in some point of their lives its part of life to fail no one is perfect. people should never loss hope if they fail they should be determined to make it through and be successful. Hope is so important in peoples lives because lets say if someone loses they child and if that person losses hope they would stop looking for their child and if they stop looking for their child they will never find him or her. Failure is important in peoples lives because it make people to not lose hope but also it makes them to dedicate on what they are trying to succeed.

People should dedicate on what they are trying to achieve or on what they want to succeed. dedication is very important in everyone lives. Cristiano Ronaldo is so dedicated to soccer that is why he is so successful he was playing in the best league in Spain now he is paying in the best league in Italy. many people admire Cristiano Ronaldo because started from the bottom and now he is one on the best player and is one the player that gets payed the most.

in conclusion, people should never loss home and they should be dedicated to be successful. Having hope is very important to succeed, also to succeed people need to be dedicated and determined. In other words, to succeed people need to fail and get back up again and again.
