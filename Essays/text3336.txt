I agree that imagination is more inportant than kowledge beacus in imagination I feel like you learn more about your brain and that will help you a lot knowledge you really dont learn anything you just learn how to other people choose what you like. Imagination you can think about what to choose like if there is a car you like imagen if you didint choose the other one that one is going to the dumster if was one good car and one ugly car but if it was knowledge you will have pressure. You will not know what to pick or you will know what to pick if you use your imagination. Knowledge you really have to decide what you want but imagination you just can imagen like what are you going to need that in your life like if you had to choose a house or a car what will you need more in life thats why you use your imagination so i rather pick a house beacus you will need that house when you grow up like for your kids. knowledge i feel its bad for you in the futcher. When you go to college you will have to use your knowledge for school i guss that is preety good but you are just going to imagen like you are done in college.
