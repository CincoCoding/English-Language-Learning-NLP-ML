This sentece is literaly true, because you never to be idle, because you can do wonderful things, just need belive a little bit more on yourself and always we need think that sometimes we commit a mistakes, and that's good because the mistakes is how we can learn about that nobody is perfect, no metter if are wrong things or good things, always you learn that the life is not easy, but is not impossible, so don't be scary, the life is a game and you decide if you want to be a winner or a loser.

So you don't think that to be mistaken is wrong, but if you make a mistake, try to don't do it again. I give you a example: If you are on a game (football,soccer,basquetball,etc), so if you are on any game and your time is lose, but you know the wron in the other team, so you know that you can attack on this wron and you can won the game, or if you lose that game but you got the revenge, well now you know where is the wrong and maybe your team won the game. So you can make a mistake, but no more that one time.
