I agree with Churchill's to be success consists of going from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm, it that's matter if you are failure and you are not even losing your enthusiasm but at list you try, that is the most important thing.

First of all,

you will never know everything but the most important things is trying because if you dont try, you will never learn, but sometime its okay to be failure without a enthusiasm that means that you dont care, you are not interesting in anything or another way to see that dont have a enthusiasm is when you waste time for example if i feel like i am just losing every time and i dont even has a enthusiasm, something to be focus, I will enjoy my time to try to better, to be a winner I always will be try to increase.

Secondly, some time people love to be a better person but there will be people who doesnt enjoy the time to increase, I just know one thing for sure sometime people like to stay in the same step because if you want to be a winner, you must try and see what you can do to go up, I will try to have a good future, a better future for my family, to have my own things, living failure make you a weak person everyone can see that you are weak, that you are not smart enough , that you are comfortable for what you have, but you must be a ambition person to have more than what you have.

Thirdly, if you dont want to live failure you must to win the opportunity, I just know that this world is for smartest people, here survive the person who can use there brain carefully, people who are not making bad mistake but we are humans,m humans make mistake but that is okay you must fix it you must to increase yourself to keep something in your heart that can motivate yourself.

Concluion, on my opinion i can said its okay if you want to stay in the same step,but you will never understand the meaning of life if you never try, you shoul try at least one time.
