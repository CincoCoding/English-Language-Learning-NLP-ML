I agree with Albert Schweitzer " Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is he only thing." Setting a example to others it's the best way to influence others because for example there are two students named Generic_Name and Generic_Name. Both of them are in the same school. Generic_Name has good grades he is always doing his school work, never dose anything to upset the teachers or get in terable while Generic_Name is the complet opposite.

Generic_Name has poor grades, always talking back to his teachers and never dose his school work he also get in to fights with other students. Generic_Name has a idea he wants to help Generic_Name to become a better person and influence him to do well in school. Generic_Name have the same first block class as Generic_Name. Generic_Name decided to get bad grades and talk back to his teachers.

Generic_Name is doing all of this because he wants Generic_Name to realize just because you have bad grades in school that dose not mean you can not change that. The next day Generic_Name gets good grade he apolegize to his teachers and Generic_Name seas Generic_Name having bad geades and the next day Generic_Name change that and started doing good agine. Generic_Name thinks to him self if Generic_Name can change so can I. The first thing he dose is to go and apolagize to his teachers for being rude he started studing, getting good grades. The moral of this was that some one's behavior could have a influence on others this is why I agree with Albert Schweitzer.
