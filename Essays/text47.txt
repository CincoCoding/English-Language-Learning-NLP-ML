I agree, because you threw failure to be successful. Like entrepreneur they are smart business people and they lose a lot of money trying to start a business some entrepreneur go threw lot of failure like people not buying their products, Losing money that they spent on the products without making no profit and some spend to much money for promotion and some of tha entrepreneur need a sponsor to support their business to get more customers to buy the products they sell and if the costomers like and value the products their business will do lot of sale and getting the business to the big league with some of the biggest brand and company in the world and business will be sucessful.

the entrepreneur business was't doing right that didn't stop he or she from pushing toward their goals, so in life you go thew a lot of failure you lose some you win tha sholdn't stop you from doing what you do in life a want to be.
