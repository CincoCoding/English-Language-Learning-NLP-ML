Do you think you give off right by having a negative attitude? Imagine being at the DMV everyone given you stares, and your family telling you ''you're not gonna pass". As you sit taking the test ,all those comments replaying in your head. Can you see the difference? as if i was to be possitive, my attitude reflects off of what i give, and that is the key of success in life.

A positive vibe can make your days go faster. Everyone in this world has challeges, but i mean who doesn't? so with that being said we can overcome with putting effort and what you do or believe. The ability to have a positive attitude creates a mind set of trying new things, like driving, traveling, last but not least, education. Adjusting to a new enviroment helps alot with mental health.

My story starts with me going to the DMV. something i notice was, i was hearing negative comments about me not passing my test. My friends kept telling me that is was difficult and hard. Meanwhile at the time, it kept replaying in my head, and i reacted in a negative way.

One way we can avoid being gloomy is to stop hanging out with people who are bad influence, because if we do we give off the same energy. However if you will have potential on succeeding,and you well feel much better of your self.

Some people say that being negative is normal, but they are wrong because if you are always negative everyday that will not take you enywhere. It is always good to be positive, and if you are positive all things go well. In conclusion, is how we the people should change the way we see things, and move foward for better result. I hope that we can be more considerate on how we take things in life.
