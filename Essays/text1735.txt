Dear principal

my name is STUDENT_NAME and I don't agree with the new school sports policy. My opinion about the school policy that no one should be left behind that every one should have a chances to participate in the sport that they want to play. Am an example because I cant play sports because of my grades I love to play volleyball butt i cant participate i fell left out. When I see the other girls with there uniform am I just look away that just makes me fell like dam I should be on the team. I know that there is more kids out there that want to participate and fell the same why I do.

Some kids

that I know are in gangs because of that reason. Ether just because of that resounds that they cant participate.T
