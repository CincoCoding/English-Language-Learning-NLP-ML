well to start off i do agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson on what he wrote because in my postion for me it is true like he said "unless you try to do somehting beyond what you have already done"

you need totry and see how it works out and if you are succesful with it then you master it even more bigger to become even more bigger so that is why i agree with what Ralph Waldo wrote.

one reason why i agree with Author Ralph is beacuase it is true once you mastered somehting you can also do something beyond like bigger. so that is one reason why i agree with what he wrote second reason why i agree with Ralph Waldo when he says "unless you try to do something" which i think its true if you try to do something and u make a mistake you can keep trying like lets say you go to collage and you failed 3 class and you give up which its not a good idea because you will make mistakes in life not all the time but sometimes so that is what i think when he says "unless you try to do something" means like you at least need to try once and see how it goes. thrid reason is he says you will never grow and what he is trying to say is that if you master somehting beyond that what you have already acomplished and you go more bigger then you will grow because you did somehting on your own and bigger so that is why i think there is a thrid reason.

These are all the reasons why i agree with waht he wrote and why i agree with him like i said you ned to try to bigger things in life and become more succesful and get more better things have what you want like buy a car a house and go on vaction with your famliy and like i said for reason two i said if you try and make a mistake you need keep on trying and become a better person. so that is what i think about what he wrote and why i agree with him.
