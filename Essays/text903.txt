peple can changes they first impresion

In this ocation i am disagree with this statment because sometimes people act different like when I firt meet my grilfrind I

was thinking that she was a happy person but with the thime I see that she was not that happy my impresion changes of that situation.

The majority of the people act different when they meet some a person that they going to meet for example, when you going to see a job you need to act happy and smile to they can acept you but in realiti you are sad so with the timethey changes that first impresion.

So alot of people when they meet a person they have a diffferent impresion so the other person can think that she or he is happy or have a good firt impresion or some times you act normal but we the tome you changes and your impresion too.

another reason is when you whent at new school at the first time you act that you are cool and you say things that they like to they can acept you so with the time they going to know that was a diferent impresion.

In my opinion I think that your first impresion can changes, because in the first Iimpresion it is not your self so when you go to work they can know who are you and they going to acept you like that so when you going to mmet a person be your self because that going to be your impresion.
