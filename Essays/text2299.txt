People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincs and ideas. Many people today and day has the problem about how to take decisions is so hardnees to take your own decisions, because some people think a lot of what decisions to take that's the principal moment that we need help from someone isnt's matter if your dad, mom or an expert . Sometimes in life you have to take your own decisions because you can fell or not but you're going to learn what's good or bad, taking your owns decisions it teach you many things about how to take your own decisions with responsabilitie . I take my own decisions because that can help me to grow as a person but yes sometimes we need somebody also opinion .

However , not everyone thinks like that because they like to ask for and opinion to an expert because, they think that can make you to take the decions easily and that's right but isn't enought for some people because probably they have done before and it doesn't feel enought for them , because that's the opinion that you're receiving probably you can be agree or not, but you still are thinking in what decision shoult they take decisions are not something easy nothing is easy in this life that's one obstacle in life basicaly is one step that can help you to grow as person because you can learn from bad decision that you have taked in the past.

Nevertheless ,

everyone can go to see and expert he or she can give you many types of ideas about what decision you shoul take but when you depends on someone you will never going to learn how to take decisions by your self, how I

say before that is one step the can help you to grow as person, you're growing base on what life is giving you is not matters if is good or bad but that's how you know what's better for you and it help you to grow as a person, makes your life succefully.

Moreover , you don't have to take decisions by your self everything is depending on the problem it can not be a problem especificaly but in case is very important to count with other person opinion it can make your decision more easy ,like my grandfather tell me every time when I talk to him '' be sure of what are you doing'' and what I reffer with that is the you must be right of what are you doing is so important you always count with friends or someone speciall in your life those people can make your life better and far away of the problems .

Overall , people have to take their own decisions using the best way for each of them , Because decisions are not easy to take you must take it without precupation because when we worry about that and we say or we do the first thing that it comes to our brain isn't one hundred percent right sometimes it can be good or not but that's how we learn of our mistakes , that's how life work , it give you a hit when you must think nothing is going to happend, that's why is important to count with friends or your mom and dad but when you're going to ask an opinion of what decision shoul you take you must ask an adult , they are the only ones that they can give you the best ideas of what is better for you and your future and that's how you learn and the most important to grow as a person .
