They say that conserving energy and resources, some buissness have a four day work week consisting ten houres a day. Extending the school day two houres and a four day school week ain't a bad idea for people who need's more help and are focusing on their future and college. Do you think this is a great idea? Yes, because the more time your at school the more time you'll be learning and getting help. If added 2 more houres to school on a four day school week, the more school work will be finished and learned. I think my school should fallow this model because in my opinion test and quiz scores will show a greater improvement over time.

First reason why my school should have a four-day week school with a exteded 2 houres is because, many work can be done at school and teachers would have more time to explain details with deeper nolige. Teachers could have more time to study practice with the students before taking their test like using websites like kahoot's. it/quizlit. live and notes so the students can feel confident of what they have learned. This will be consiting longer periods for every class that every student and teachers will have to make sure every student leave the school grounds successfuly and informed of what they have learned that day.

Second reasons is that being in school for 2 more houres will help you work smoothly at every class. Plus every student will be haveing a three day weeknd from Friday to Sunday to rest and to have more time to complete homeworks and to study for testes and quizies. I could get work done when i have not been in school because i was sick or on vacations to get back on track with my studies and school work. Great idea for people at school becasue they won't have any excuss of loosing or not finishing work.

Those are the reasons why a four-day school week is a fantastic idea with a 3 day weeknd everyday. And ways for students to be ready for college and to get good grades everytime with extra help.
