Student should not find a career at a young age because they haven't choose or think about what career they want to have many student think about what career they want at a young age but, it's better to find what carrer they want when they enter high school because student can talk to a counseling to see what they are intrested in and can see what carrer is similar to what they like.

A lot of student have troubling time to find what career they want to have many student career doesn't end so well, once they enter high school student can find what career to have in the future, student can even visit a website to see what career are intresting for them or can visit careers search in school..

If i have to choose a career at a young age i would not think of anything because i haven't find what career i'm intresting in also, it'll be better i enter high school and find what career i like and enjoy because thinking of what career i want would be hard at a young age also, i can talk to a teacher about career in high school so they can help me of what career are available that are right for me and i don't think student should find a career at a young age it would be hard for them to find one.

I have to disagree of student finding a career at a young age because if student do find a career at a young age then they won't be forcusing in school work they mind will be them having that career by now and will brag about it to there friends and teacher no one want to hear thats also, it may not be the right career for them they need time to think the right career they want to enjoy in life.
