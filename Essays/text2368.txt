What would happen if school offer the program to student that qualify for the program that only take three year of high school instead of the four years. Here are some examples, and reason why is a good idea for school to offer this types of programs.

Reason number one is that students that had A's and B's in the past years like middle school and the beginning of high school maybe qualify for the three year insted of the four year of high shool, because they are so intelligen that they not need the four years of high school.

Reason number two is that if they graduate from high school they may like to apply for a community service for there college aplication.

Reason number three is that some student don't have the money to pay for college so they may need a year to save some money to pay for college, or some student may not like college so they are only going to finish high school, and they are going straight to work, and the more experience you learnd form a jod the better it is so is a good idea to begin at a younger age.

So i think that the program that school offer to studen for them to take the opportunity to graduate early from high school is a good idea beacuse it will help them alot in there life.
