should churchill's statement About the importnat role that failure plays in the pursuit of success be true. I think that failure plays a big role to success but is just for those who really want to changed their lifes. First of all, learned something from any failure. Second of all, A failure shows up the real people. Third and most important, try not to do the same failure over and over.

"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiams". First of all,learned something from any failure because we are humans and we all make big mistakes in our lifes. Those who learned form their mistekas are the best to help the ones that are passing the same process. Learn because there would be always more failures in our lifes. Second of all, a failure shows up the real people because those who you think are good friends would help you on a failure. the person that you thought was the worst could be the only one helping you. An example, A real girlfriend would never run away in your first failure. Third and most important, try not to do the same failure over and over becuase the first think you loss is your enthusiams when you had been passing the same failure for many times, it becomes harded not to loss it. There is always gonna be more failures in our lives but, if u dont even pass one it would be more difficult to pass more then one at the same time.

My conclusion, everyone has a failure or more in their lifes but the most succes full thing of a failure is to pass the page knowing that you had learned something good of it and you wont do the same mistake ever again. Everyone has the opcion to change their lifes but the key word for this is that the person has to want it and be ready to changed.
