Do you think that high schoool should only be 3 years instead of 4 years. well some might say it would be better having 3 year's of school other then 4 year's. but the way to achieve it is difficult.

I think that school should be only 3 years. beacause some student don't really want to be in school for too long. this can give student's a goal so that they don't have to stay for 4 years. it would give the students a higher chance to focus in school and then head out to college for those who are interested.

I belive that if student's can find a goal of having to be going for 3 years in school instead of 4 year's. it would take them hard work and confident in order to earn it but other's might say that they perfer to be in school longer. because of friend's or liking to learn alot and it no rush toward them for they are interted in learning.

but in the future I hope that evey student can find a way to be seccessful in there time in school.
