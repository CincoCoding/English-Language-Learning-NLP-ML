In my opinion I think the kid's that don't listen to there mom and dad. then They need this program the most. One the older student this telling the younger student what to do. And the older student is acting like there parents. Then if they do the program for like 3 or more time a week then,the younger student will get use to it. And the they will maybe listen to there mom and dad.

How is this program going to help them later on when they have kid's. This is for the older one one. Because he or she is telling younger kids what to do and it pretty much just getting ready when they have kid's later on. And it also teaching they how to respect there orders.

this program is going to help both younger kids and older kids because... Then a older person tells you to something. you should do it. its called respect your orders. Like if u respect other people it dont matter how old you are. You just have to respect older people. And one more time it's just going to prepare the older students when they have kid's. And younger kids how to behave in fort of there parents.

And what i wrote about. Is how is program is going to help they later on in life. How it's going to help both older student and younger student. Also my opinion on who need this program the most.
