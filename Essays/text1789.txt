I donr undertan why people is stupid to ''act' as someone else. From my point of view, is so stupid. Also, there is Latinos who copy other Latino's accent trying to be cool or staff, and it's not make sense, because that means they do not love their own country and do not have self-steem. Because with that they're showing someone who is not themselves. And the most stupid thing is when they show some love to their country and apparent like nothing happen. That means being doble face. I do not like that kind of people. However, that's no the only thing. People start to follow what someone else say. For example, if someone say that they like short hair, someone else do it to feel a little bit of atention. What I want to get with that is,that they is another people who do not have atention or love and start doing things to their friend or other people start to pay them atention. Personally, I feel comfortable with the little what I have. It's not my idea be someone that I don't. And I also start to be neutral. How is it? For me, it's like if someone want to be friend, good; if people do not want to meet me, it's ok, too. Lastly, I don't care about other people, I only care about me, my 4 friends and my family, and that's it. I feel I don't need to meet more people. I'm good with what I have, because while less people I met, less people treason me.
