I agree, because I think the influence helpen people when he or she smocking to much and need to stop smocking because the smoking is to bad for the body and think. The other I

think is to bad is the alcold because when people drinking to much after making crasy.

I thinking the position is becuase the parent don't influences when she or he are younger.

For example; when I,m childrem I living with my grandmother but she tell me when you have like 13 or 14 years old don't smoking because the cigari is not good for your life. And other example she tell me is don't drinking beer.

Im remenber one thing and I don't forget is when my grandmother tould me is contion with yours goals and don't stoped.

The other influences in my life is when came to united usted I don't speaking english but now I speaking more better because I ready book when stay home or when I have time. And other example because I speaking more better is when I'm not undertand the question I tell my teacher can helpen me in this question because

I don't undertand to mucho.

One example when the teacher tell you and you listen is if you need speaking more better is listen to the teacher when she or he sprey something and you paid atention.

One example when I finish the high school is I want to be a soccer pleyer and I want to player in one famous team. Becuase what is one goals in my life and because the soccer is the best player in the mood. I also what is one goals for me is because when a have like 5 or 6 years old I play for the first time. I think is the first becuase all of my family love soccer and players.

My other goals is finish the high school next years. And start to work for helpen my parent and make my money for something I need for myself. And also because I need to make money for pay my college. And for pay car also.
