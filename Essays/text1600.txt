"Unles you try to do somthing beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow".

Yes you will never grow becuase you will never have now experience, that will need in the feater I agree with author Ralpn Emerson for three reasons. First, whan you try a now things you are going to have different naleg about a laset of different thing . Sconed , whan you have different ideas you have different way of thinking. Thired , whan you try to see other people and how they act and thiar coolter you will now how to talk with thim without disrspact thim . Lastly, that why we sholed alwase laren.

Whan I try a now things i alwas laren some thing now .

For exampe, whaen i came to the U.S i did not have enafe naleg about what is in the U.S so that was a issue ror me learening the language i shragl becuase did not go beyond what i have already mastred. Than ,whan i staret to learen more about the language i start to go beyond my noleg. Allthuo life is hared and learening is hared but som times whan you learen a lote you get a lote .

whan you have different ideas you have different way of thinking. First , people wode love to talk to you and now you. Sconed, whan you in school you will have a lots of ideas about what class to take . Thired, Knowing a lot healp your famliy tow . finely that why haveing a lot of ideas healp you.

Whan you try to see how other people and how they act and how thiar coolter is you now how to talk with thim othout disrspact thim. first, whan you you lisone to people and how the talk you going to larn e what cined of pirson he is and how to talk with thim . Sconed , you can choos the prson that you are going to love from larning about how the siseaty work . Third, bieing nice to every one mens you are goning out and seeing other people . and, that whay i agreed with the auther Ralph Waldo Emerson becuase going beyond what you have already mastered is laring .
