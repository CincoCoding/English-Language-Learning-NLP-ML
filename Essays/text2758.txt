I disagree with what John Lubbock saids "Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it." I strongly disagree because we are influnced by the people we hang out with. Like for example in America we have diferent accents all around the map and thats because the people near us influnce one another. They influnce one another by sharing cultures and beliefs. For example in louisiana they have martigra but it did not originate in louisiana, in new york they have a lot of italian people, and we all enjoy eating ethic food such as chinese food, tacos, pupusas, italian food. All of those things influnced americans and their traditions and customs which impacts thier morals.

As we all know everyone has morals but those morals are influnced by people, such as our friends, family, teachers and coworkers. Ones morals has a big role in character. I would even say its the biggest factor in what builds pur character. A persons moral is what tells them what is right and what is wrong, what they should do or what they should not do, wether to pick option A or option B. Morals are a part of someones character, its what builds thier charater. For example if someones morals aren't made up and they do not know what is good and bad then thier character might need some work.

I get where Mr. Lubbock gets the idea of "Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it" but I also think that social class has alot to do with your character. I think that the different social groups have a varaity of character building factors. I believe this because for example a person that only makes 20 grand a year has a lot more struggles than a person that makes 100 grand a year and those struggles impact ones character.

In conclusion I disagree with John Lubbock because I believe morals, social class and people around us influnce our character. I believe all those factors play a major role on who we are because it is human nature to adapt to surroundings.
