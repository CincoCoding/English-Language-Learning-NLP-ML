"Unless you try to do something beyong what you have already mastered,you will never grow"

I think this is wrong becuase if you commit a mistake and you want to fix you cant due no matter what happen you always have a second change to grow.

Firts,Im explain my topic whith details a person who is due something for class always need help for others student's for example: All the students have differents opinions,but only one is the leader of the work they must be discuss the problem and star working. The people on the group don't have the same idea that the others have the work is amost finish but is not good enough,they present the work but is not good,the leader say I dont acept this work becuase is incomplete the students talk more the topic and they star working again in the problem. The people in the group never say I dont want to due this work,becuase all the people have to prove her self,they say maybe the work is not good but we can't make this again,you never have to felt that you cant not due becuase you cant grow no matter what happen you cant due again and star again.

Second,In situations you feelt that the things that you due or make are wrong ,but in not becuase the all the people in this world have a second or three changes to improve,and if you make a mistakes first is not matter that you have to made the same mistake again,you must be improve your self,world,class,and the people that you have you never have to feel grow becuase that word is not exist for a person who every day is triyng to make a good work. My other example is a person who is guilty to due a crimen and this person want to have a education to grow like a human that we are they must be giving the oportunity to study no matter what he due or make because all the people have the same staight.

I know that many people are gona to be upset with me becuase they must think, a person who make a crimen don't need a second change but for my opinion the have a second change becuase they are in jail for the crimen and the want to grow to be a better person. All the people in the world have a second change becuase if you make something that you are not prove you must be make that again you never have to say I don't want to due this or

I don't have a might to make this,that is wrong you cant due everything in this world is possible, and I know that this people are annoyance for what I think but is only my opinion becuase nobody want to be in jail and never learn somehing for your future, the people who is upset with me why they don't think if you are in the same situation you have to think in you and also the other people to make this world a little better.

In my conclusion, the people have always a second change to grow,the human that we are we have to think in us but also in the others person like example: this text is for a world to make this a better place to live, becuase all the people in this country is fortunate becuase have so many oportunities to grown and be prepare for te future in other hand I come from a country that don't have opportunities but my goal is to be a better person today, tomorrow and for my future.
