What if you can go vist anywhere in the world? Where would you go,their are many place in the world but I would want to go to Hawii.

I would want to vist hawii with freinds and family. Because we can go to the beach,we can eat coconuts,ice cream and we can get a nice tan. We can go surfing. Me and my freinds and femily can live in a house all together near a nice beach. And we can have a lot of fun on the nice beach

First we will have to find a house near a beach. Then we will have to put what ever we brought on the trip into the room we picked. Then we can get some stuff for the beach like surf boreds,some sun screen,sun glasses, and some stuff for the sand. And when the sun goes down we can watch it,and we can watch the sun go up in the morning.

After we get the stuff for the beach then we can go to the beach. When we have the stuff for the beach we can use the surf boerd to go surfing. Me and my brother and freinds can have a race with the surf boerds. After we are done having fun on the beach we can stop by somewhere and get something to eat then we can get some nice ice cream.

This is why I picked Hawii out of any place in the world and I hope that one day that I will wake up to the sound of waves and see the sun rise up out of my window and eat coconut out side on the beach.
