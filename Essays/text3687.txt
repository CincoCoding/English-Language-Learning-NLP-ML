I agree with Emerson's statement about individuality "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisehment" because of Success,being yourself,and being the owner of you life.

First success is the most important thing for the sociaty because we all need great people like philantropist who help reducing povrety in the world,great inventor who creat thing tahat today we cannot live whith out it such as Car,internet,and computer. and the Evolution of Human being by creating a safe enviroment for everyone to live a long and healthy life.

Secondly being yourself is a great accomplishment because you truely the person you want to be, you are true to the people around you being showing them who you really are by acting truely without faking who you are,and you are live a meaninfull live by being yourself instead of what the world want you to be.

Thirdly being the owner of you life is really important because you can your own decide, you can decide what kind of futur you want ,and being able to make this decisision by yourself will make you life greatfull,and mostly an healthy live.

Some people will said that is worthless or is better to be told what to do,but being able to creat your Success,being yourself,and being the owner of you life is somthing really important for the development of Human life and for every individu to dicide what they want to be or what they have plan for they futur.

All this will drive a person to a great accomplishment because life is a text and every individu have a different text so being yourself in this world will always be a great accomplishment because some people a conditioner to live the live that the world gave them.
