My first impressions was when i come in on this country. Because i did't know nothing me and my brother. We didi't know how are the think, or how work, we did't know how to speak the lenguage

But one day i say no more for everything no mero sad etc. And i say in my own i can do that to. Because I am a person, if the another people can do that, i can do that too. So my first step what i did to star. Was to learn the lenguage, because the lenguage is the most importenthing. Because you can deffend your self.

If you learn the lenguage you can do a lot thing.

Like for examplo you can go to the store, and buy something that you like,

or you can go to a restouran, and buy whatever you like of food etc. Another thing what you can do with the lenguage. Is to get a essy job, or you can meet a American friends. And had a normaly converseation.

For that i agree, that nothing is impossible because if i change my setuation you can change your i know that is not essy but not is impossible all of that is going to help you to overcome your self for that you has to nerver give up.
