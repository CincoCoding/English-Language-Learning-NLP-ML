If I could go any where in the world I would go to France. The reason I would go to France is because a lot of people said that

France was a romantic and beautiful place to go. And the food there is amazing in France they also have a really good accent. But the main reason i want to go to France is because of the thing to see their stuff like the ifle tower. the other reason is to meet other people so in that case i would have to travel on a day theres going to be a lot of people.

The reason I would go to France is to have the knowledge to be able to tell someone about how it changes you and how it's like and different temperature like how the country is to going to change on bad temperature their might just a small amount of people outside. On a good day there is going to a people are walking around having fun. You also try to see if the people their nice or mean to other people.

If I ever had a choice to go to France I would say yes and when I get the first thing i would try is there food. Because a lot of people said that the food in France is delicious so I thought what if i try to get my own opinion. To me it feels good to be apart of something it doesn't feel good to be the third wheel just staying back watching them give there feedback but have no clue what they'er talking about.

The animals in France are not that dangerous and the cats and dogs are exreamly cute. Like chuwawas are so cute and the most known animals in France at lest that what i have seen on television. Most people in France like animals and chuwawas design which makes them look better.
