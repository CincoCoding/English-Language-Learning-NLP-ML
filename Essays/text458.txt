Interviews... seems like that's the new way of teaching someone a job that one really wants to pursue and make a living out of. Not in our school, that's why we have the chance to get selected in internships or either shadowing opportunities for us to actually have the chance to work hands-on in the field of work that we want to pursue in life and do what we each student have an interest in. One reason i would like to be selected is because i would put one hundred percent of my attention and actually participate in all task we would have in the internships.

A reason i would like a shadowing opportunities is because i would like to see how a manager would deal with situations if a problem would ever happen when i would work. Shadowing would also be great for students would like to know how to make the job a little bit easier and faster to not waste time and sit around until a manager shows up and fixes the problem so they could start working again, that's why a shadow opportunities would be great to actually see how a manager would deal with a situation,

so then would later that we as interns would deal with the problems instead of calling a manager and waiting for him to solve it.

Shadowing is something i have never done before, i've always had interviews and get told that what i would be doing in a job that i applied for but have never really done it before getting hired to see if i would really would like the job i applied too, that's why our school gave us the chance to have the chance to be selected to be able to see if we would actually committed to the job we like and be ready to work.

In conclusion, i would like to say that i would be real eager to have the opportunitie to have an internship or either the chance shadow a manager and see him work the magic in the job that would interest me after college and thank you for giving the time to read my letter to you and hope to see if i was selected to have the chance, thank you.
