Some businesses have adopted a four day work week with each day consisting of ten hours

.To conserve energy and resources, my school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours. because everyone get tired or estreced, do not make enought money to buy resources, and dont have enougt time to be with the family.

The beneficts to conserve energy is to sleep the eight hours. so you can conserve the energy and don't be extreced about be more time in school. In contrast if you do not sleep well you feel like you will felt sleep. so is better less hours of school because eveyone will conserve enegy and the less hours of school can bemore better because everyone would be consentrated and learn more.

Is hard to be in school and have a job after school. because both of them are important for our life. but must people what need is money. so must people prefer to work and make money than have more hours of school. for this reason many people prefer to have money because can buy any resources or enyting that they need.

for example. If I am working and also going to school and the school day extend for two hours. I feel very extreced, so many peolple cuit school. And prefer to work.

There are also some disadvantages because if they extend the school day two hours is not inought time to be togeteher with the family.

everyone need time to have and be with the family because family is importan. so for these reason my chool should not fallow this model. if you spend more time in a job or in school there is not enought time for the family and olso everyone need time to make the differents responsabiliies that have.

for these reasons my school should not follow this model because many people get extreced or cuit school. so they can conserve anergy and resources and have have enought time with the family. and the hours of school everyone can be more consetrated and don't felt sleep and learn the possible.
