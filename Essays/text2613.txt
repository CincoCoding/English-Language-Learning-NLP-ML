It can effect people in a good way by lighting up their day or just talking to people helps them. Doing small act of kindness can really help people by if they lost money and you found it and you gave it back that helps them or you clean their car for them that could mean a lot to the person. picking up trash can help the earth that why no matter how small act of kindness it is' it can still have a big impact on someone day. I think more people should start being kind to other. tell me this when someone is kind to you. you feel happy right knowing that someone cared to do that thing for you when your being kind to other they feel the same feeling as you do knowing that someone cares about you. and when people show kindness it usually comes back to them in any forms like a person give you a bag of chip because that person was feeling kind. that all my reason that people should that being kind to others. how kindness can help you is when your car turns off when your in the road people will come and try to help you that's kindness they were kind to come and help you. when your stuck on the homework you ask your friends for help there being kind enough to help you. volunteer help people if something happened to their homes volunteer help people for no pay they are being kind. this is all my reason kindness is never wasted and how it can come back to and how it effect people and how it helps them and why you should do it.
