Dear Generic_Name

I understand that you are considering the benefits of working with a group or working alone. This could be a big deal depending the class because the majority of students prefer to work alone, we should use some of the time that we have in class to vote and see what students want, but i agree with the idea of working with a group for two reasons: we can devide the work and you get to talk to other students while their working.

First reason is that it feels like we do get the enough time to work, when we get to work with groups everything gets a lil bit more easy because there is less work to do, and if they decide to work alone, you would notice that they are going to have more problems completing the assignment, while the other studens that are working in group they would find this assignment more easy, so the way the teacher don't have to spend to much time with only one student.

Second reason is that they should not have problems finding the information because while some of them are writing the other students should it be serching for anwsers, for example, students that are working alone they would find this a lil bit harder because they have to do the writing and searching part by them self. The best part of working with a group is that the work can be finished a lot faster and they can have more time to recheck the work and make sure that you are not missing anything in blank.

Also, there is a lot of benefits of working with a group or working alone, but its clear that those students are not going to work with other students because they say that they don't like to be talking to other students, that they prefer to work alone, but anyways the teacher should be agree with this, thats how she would know if you need more help with the assignment then other students.

I strongly believe that working with a group could be the best choice for students because they are not going to spend to much time doing the assignments, so you could work with someone and devide the work wich positively affects, therefore, we must try it and see what benefits can we get from this and voting could be a good idea to decide if students would like to work in group.

Sincerely,
