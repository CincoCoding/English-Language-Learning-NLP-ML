Conserve Energy and Resources

To conserve energy and resosurces; today is good option to safe our planet. Some businesses or schools take the best opcion for their benefits. However;during long time ago,bussines and schools did not take care about this problem. They did not know that energy and reosurces,one day is going to affect our population. Then,businesses and schools started to take care about this problem. However; businesses and schools wanted to see benefits and disadvantages .

Businesses,took its best option that it was adopted a four-day work week ,to converse energy and resources. Some schools want to follow this model by extending the school day two hours. In my opinion, this is good option.

First one,Taking this option; my school will have availability to help the environment and the population. because they will using just 20 hours. This is going to be a perfect benefit for the school and environment. For example: If the school is just taking 20 hours; they will have the benefit to share energy with others schools or communities
