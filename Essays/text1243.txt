Schools have partnered with local companies to let students explore the certain professions that local workplace perform the type of work you would like to pursue.

Many school pay to have a partnership with local companies some of the companies dont want to be patnershiped with the schools that are paying to be partnershiped with the company.

Sometimes local companies come to the schools and ask them to be partnershiped with the company some even ask for just a feild trip with the kids to explore the work or company to see what they have in the jobs and see what they do nonstop everyday for just work and gettin payed after a whole day of work.

Schools are wasting money to just get partnershiped with a company and also companies are wasting money for asking the teachers for a feild trip to go see the jobs what are going to do to stop the paying money part i know how about ask the teachers for a feild instead of paying the teachers and begging them to do the job that they going to tak the kids to the job after your done.
