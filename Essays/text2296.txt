Technology has negative effect on our life here is why .In school the teacher goes over present ion online and it does not teach the student how to do there assignment . Because of the technology there is no teacher and student connection. In my country when i was young we did not had any technology my teacher would go over the assignment and he would explain the assignment on the board and if you did not get it .He would explained it to you again thats what school should be about making a connection with the teachers. I remember when i was young me and my friends would hangout in the cafeteria we would talk about our day.
