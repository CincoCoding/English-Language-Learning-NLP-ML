First,for example some people prefer working in grougp because they would get extra help. The other person in the group become with a new idea. I think working in group it is fun becuase each person in the group would l help. That why I prefer working in group than alone because the desventage of working alone is I can not get help from anyone. Also I can not finish it early it would take long.

Second, for example If I work in group we would descuss first and then be an a agreement. Then start working each person in group would have to answer and with different answer. If any one in the group does not know the answer the group would help him or her. It is easy and fast to finish any class work if it is in group. Working in group it is fun because each person learn from another idea of the other person.

Third, working by yourself it is kinda hard. Some people prefer working by themself because they think it better. Working alone is more stressful. That why people should work in group. It help and it is more better and less use of their mind.

Fourth, for example if I do a classwork by myself and it is hard. It would take me more time to do the researchs in google. Also I would finish it late. That why I prefer working in group than alone.

fifth, finally I would like to recomend to each students to work in group unless they are smart enough to do it by themself. However some students or people like to wotk alone if they smart then probably they would finish it on time. Teacher should be agree with me. When students work in group it is less stressful because they can hel each other. Therefore students or people should work toguether because it is less stressful and it would benefits a lot.
