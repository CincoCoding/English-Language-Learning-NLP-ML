I think that my principal need reconsidering the school's cell phone policy.

First of all , the principal should let allow all students to bring phones to school and use them only during lunch periods , free time , and when a student have a emergency . Because you don't if a student's mom is calling because a emergency happen.

As you can see , that the principal need to let the student to have there cell phone , as long as the phone is turned off during class time or is in bivariate . That is why the principal need to let us use the cell telephone during school.
