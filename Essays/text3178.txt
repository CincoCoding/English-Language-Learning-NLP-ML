The great artist Michelangelo once said, "The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."

This is mena that people setitng their direction to high they falling quick, but they setting their direction too low that achieve their mark.

For my opinion, people set their aim as high as they can, because they know that if they set too low; they won't have that power to finish or to get it. This made people thought their aim is high; they need to work harder not just the 100 precent they need to put more than 100 precent into it and get thieir aim. Not all the people can reach as high as they set, but at least they try eventhought they fall they still on a good postion. For example, I have a quze total points is 100 and I try to get the full points, but in the end I only get 85, it's still good, because I know my aim is high, I need to do hard. When people set their aim too low, they won't have that power to finish it, because you know that it's easy to get it, and you don't even have to prepare or try for it. This make you don't know what you really want and need. It will let you just stuck there. From my opinion, I really agree Michelagelo's satement "The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."

In my conclusion, people should set their aim as high as they can, eventhought they cannot reach it, but at least they try it, but don't set a easy aim that you don't even have to try your best to get it, this will not improve yourself.
