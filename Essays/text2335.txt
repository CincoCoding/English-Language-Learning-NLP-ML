I,d kinda have to agree with micky here (least favorite tmnt turtle) because, if you don't aim high but go for short you might not get anywhere in life.

Like when you aim low like only work in fastfood and only get paid minimum wage forever, then get a job for a company like samsung of nintendo and get paid more then that.

1 of the examples is the debt/taxes you want to live a good life when you're down here right so do you want to live with so little money or more money that you save from a good job.

My 2nd example of this is like athletes if you learn what you did right, or wrong to achive that goal you have to push yourself further then what you are right now.

but if you succeed at the low standers your more like meh okay.

Though I can see the other way too saying you aim low but at least your aiming for something which i can get behind.
