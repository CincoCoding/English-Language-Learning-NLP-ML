Being yourself in a world that wants you to be something else is a great feeling but it takes time to be happy for a example,your parents want you to be a doctor or a lawyer but you want to be a rapper or dancer but you don't know how to tell them because you think they would would be disappointed.

would you want to make your parents to feel disappointed,ll give another example people who like the same sex, theirs been so many stories an articles of people dying because their expressing them selves a lot of people are scared so they don't tell anyone so they become depressed they use a lot drugs to lose the pain but nothing ever works.

In my opinion i agree with Ralphh Waldo Emerson it's a amazing feeling to be yourself and not follow other people because at the end of the day you need to be doing things that make you happy not for other,your priories come first be who ever you want to be like and who ever you want you live one life.
