Well i thik that is a good idea for all the students to be guide and know more about a career after high school younger age.

some reasons why they should know more aobut a career at younger age are:

They will be ready after they graduate and know'ing what are they gonna do.

It will be more easy after you graduate you don't have to worry about what career are you gonna study,

and it ognna make you more responsible.

Some students don't like this idea to be guide at a younger age they don't want to worry that much,

some student just want to finish high school firts and they have 4 years to decide what are they gonnna do after high school and what career are they gonna pick.

In conclusion staring knowing aobut college in a yourger age is no a bad idea, it will help you a lot and you will be more confindece, but they are other students who prefer to know more about college and what career they should pick after they graduate.
