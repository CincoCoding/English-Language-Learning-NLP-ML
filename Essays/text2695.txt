what you have already mastered ,those people they don't bealive they don't grow up ,that is not true we have to create a new things improve us self we don't like to stay the same place and nothing is imposible.

I'm agree with Emerson's statement what I already know that's a adventage for us . because it is easy doing something what we have already know ,but if we never try it , and we never know if we can do it, I need improve my self and switch my position that's a new goal . so many people they do not bealive them self , well we born poor people , so nothing is imposible ,trying what we want to do in the life . with the time we can get , and reach what we always dreaming.

You will never grow up , if you doing the same things in the life there is I lot opportunity in the world choose a new goal you will see so many change on your way don't give up.

It's easy doing what I already know because we feel comfortable doing ,for example on my work , I'm working busboy helping the server we working team work ,and easy but the problem is want to be a server but they never let me to try it i want to grow up swith a position to earn more money.

Creater a new things , we have so many skill to grow up don't be afraid doing or tying new things we want to improve us self I don't like to stay the same place doing the same things I don't see any improve on my life your life can be change a week but you have to be a positive ,don't give up , try it, isn't nothing bad.
