Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "Unless you try to do something beyond What you already mastered, you will never grow."

I agree with author Ralph Waldo Emerson because base on each experience of every people that they had mastered, i think that what you already mastered in life it can make you be more stronger base on the experience that you had.

I agree with the quote because unless you try to something you need to have pasion and focused in things that you can grow in life over things that you already mastered. You can grow beyond and over things that you already master and learn new things to keep growing not just staying in the same spot.

Experince new things in life are going to make you feel more stronger and make you think that you can do things that you maybe never thought about that you were going to do beyond what you already mastered.

Unless that you need to reach and make new goals to grow you need to make an efort no matter how hard it can be for you, you need to focus in that goals that you want to grow more and have more experience just for keep practecing.

Base on my experiences, i could do something beyond what i already mastered because i want to learn new things and try to make good things and that's going to make me grow more and experiences new things that i never thought that i can do. To grow exterior and interion i need to be confident with my self and letting me know thing that i can do better thing that i already mastered and be more suscescfull.

I agree with author Emerson's statement because of what he wrote it make me feel confident with me and keep trying beyond what i already know and already master you need to push your thought to make your goals come true.

Thank you
