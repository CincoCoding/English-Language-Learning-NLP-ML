We choose our own character traits becouse we can choose if something affect ourself for three reasons:

First, if somenthing is doesn't matter for you, it will doesn't affect you. Some people when lose something material and they don't care the material things, they looking for a solution,

Second,

if you get a problem in your workplace, you would like to resolve the problem. Some people when have a problem in her workplace want to resolve the problem because they are passive

Third, if you discuss about something to someone and the person is losing the control of ennoyance, you won't response back because you don't want more problems. Some people when someone is losing the control of her ennoyance and want to fight, they don't do anything because they are passive.

However, I know sometimes it is difficult something it doesn't affect ourself because sometimes it relate to family, or somenthing is really matter for us.

In conclusion, we choose our own character traits because we can choose if something affect ourself.
