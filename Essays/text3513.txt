I am agree whit this statement about the importance of attitude. because If you have good attitude, you can thinking carefully about the life we commit error every time. But we can learn the a adult he can give me a good advice.

If you have good family your attitude can be patient with the other people i know some time we keep bad moment but you can step out with your friends and forget everything, and you can reflect very wall your parents can be teach, good thinks and they can give you a advice for your, life some people dont like give you advice because they said we dont matter the life. some people said the adolescent not matter how they said but we are conscious the outcome.

My opinion is important to do good think in your life. Because the people remember like a good person they dont said something bad of you is important to have good attitude because is mirror how you are,in the school you need to have a good attitude because you dont want problem with the other people.

I remember some day my grandparent told me dont get problem because is bad attitude what you show to the other people you will prepare for the future when you are adult you know how to do with your boys you have good experience to show they and they can believe you.

I believe we know how to solving a problem because you need to thinking carefully and you get the answer for your problems.
