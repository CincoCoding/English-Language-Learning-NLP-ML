disagree that first impressions are almost impossible to change because the people may still get used to the place and take time know get how around work-

site and they can get loss on know we to go ,

the can have a bad day we thing happen like they car stop work and there have to ride a bus there but there traffic on the road were job site is, the can have disable that make the slow at do the work and it made take time to finisher the work,

and that why disagree we first impression are almost impossible to change but we all have bad day and other may still get use to the place and fewer have disable that we have to live with life forever but do hard work , never gave up,

a map in your phone to so you no we you go or get use to the place and one your boss may gave you a raise or you can be the next boss.
