Scientist Albert Einstein once said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge." I agree with what Albert Einstein said. Some people think its the other way around were knowledge is more important than imagination. imagination and knowledge could be used for a lot of things. I think that imagination is more powerful than knowledge because you can come up with many things and in order to get knowledge on something you need imagination.

Imagination is something you need to come up with things. You need to think about it first, get the things you need to create it, and then study from it. Imagination can help you a lot, You can use your imagination to your advantage, you can use it keep you busy. you can build things, draw things,and create things from your imagination. you can do many more things with your imagination. Imagination has no limits.

In order to get knowledge of something, you would need to use your imagination. You would need to take notes and study from it. you use your imagination to get knowledge. You can learn so much from your imagination and its very useful. we have to be careful with our imagination and our knowledge. Its ok to make mistakes while learning, you just have to learn from them.

In conclusion I think imagination is more important. We use out imagination every day. We learn things every day. It would be hard without imagination. Imagination can be used for a lot of things like making a cartoon show, drawing, and thinking. You can also use you imagination while you read. We wouldnt know much because we get our knowledge from our imagination.
