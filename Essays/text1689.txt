Each school study more that one hundred students. Many students in high school took not much hard subjects, most of them are art and music . Educational programs alredy have to take courses during the summer, if student don't finish important subjects. Making rool that student finish faster high school, must takes courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses, is not a good idea.

Most of our life need time. Hobby, learning, traveling, study in school. Each our doing, need time and study too.

What about thoose who need extra time? What about imigrants, which needs extra time to their homework. Does they will be study good? And, does they will need this program? They need time to finish their homework. Most of them don't have time to study good with four years education program.

Also, what about teachers? Does this subject will be intresting to students to study? Does they will have time to explain students, what they study? Teacher need some time to be ready for topic that give school to student. Also need explane this on lesson and after lesson, if student don't undestand this on the lesson.

Nowbody, don't have extra time.

Of course some of school can make three year of education, but only some of school. Educational program must be have extra time and be intresting to all students.
