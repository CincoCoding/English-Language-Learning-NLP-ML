Nothing comes throught untill you work for it!

I feel comfortable or confident about this quote because once you already mastered something you keep feelling as if you are still missing something or maybe you think what you already have is not enougth so, you decide to start working on a different thing or proyect just to keep making grow what you have.

In this life nothing comes easy, you have to work harder to build something or what you have in mind, once you build what you got in your mind you still probbably not going to stop trying to build more than what you already have, because you already tasted hows it feel having much, so you keep going and build more and more only because you don't feel that what you got is enougth or you liked how is feel having much.

"Dreams never come throught, untill you make them happen." That can also describe or talk a little bit, about the quote of Ralph, because when you have a dream and that dream get into the reallity you are going to think like Ralph, you going to feel that is not enought for you and you are going to start trying to do something else to make grow what you got, sometimes this can be taken as a selfishness because you want more than you have but, if someone doesn't feel goog with what they have they can keep working to make it grow.

In my oppinion I am agree with the thoughts of Ralps because if I have something and if exist other way to make grow what I have, I would definitelly going to work for it so I can make it happen; hard workers always receive their rewards in the futere.
