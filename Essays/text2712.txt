"unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered"

, you will never grow im agree i think if you wanna do something you can try. think febore to do. He says if you never grow and you have already mastered. He say you will try, because if you dont try you never know if you can to do. For example if you think osmethin and you can do so you do it if you never try you can know if you do it. So you can try something.

1. Desagree, the persons don think after do something

2. Agree they can try to do somethin better

You try to do something beyond yours hands and that is a little bit imposible if you can do you can do and thats all. The humanity do things inimaginables and thas is cool but the thing is they can try to do is impossible understannding, and if you can try and fail thats is your problem then personas can do whatever they want and thats it.
