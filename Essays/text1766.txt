Yes, i am agree with Emerson`s statement about show your own individuality.

I believe that each person has 2 face`s 1 is used in the work or in the school,and the other face is showing on specific moments in your life as stress or your soccer team is losing 5-2.

one example of that is: when you are so angry an involuntary you use bad word, and after that you feel very well with yourself. Although what you make,but some part of you is broken for what you did;That simple think make you more human as anyone in this world, because is innecesary try to be perfect when you are not ready to be perfect in this accomplishment and wonderfull world. Being more specific about my statement lets talking about; a tennager he has 17 years their birthday is in january 12 when he come to united state he had 14 years then in 3 years on school.

He make friends but those were more adult`s for them but that neve was something important to him that really change now, nevertheless every friend that he make left the school, the acctitude of him change now;he make sure to pass 2 SOL in the 11 grade but also something in their hearth was gone. He is trying to make new friend`s but no matter hom much he want their head is thinkig just as a adult; i think that this teeanager can make new friend`s why it is simple he has other face but his feelings are from a children.
