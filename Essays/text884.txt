I agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because, i think if you want to do something be yourself in the boren world then you have to change the style of living, make yourself change the way you want it to be, everyone have a different thinking and opinions about their life.

However, sometime is really hard to achief that goal, some other people can't do what they want because is take alot of time and fail, when people are doing the something the same over over again, but maybe when they are change to defferent, i feel everyone go work so early on the morning make people over time feeling really tired and bord, some people work at 3 or 4 make them tired but they can't change anything because they have no choose about their life, but people can change to a different thing so they can be more better person.

People change what they do alot but also they scare if they going to fail it, alot they don't really take a other step with something new so whatever they do, people need to change the way they think about thing around them so they can make decision about they like or don't like. Everyone got a good choose or a good decision about their life but the importand is to define the choose that they make and desigh more about they decision so they can become more better, in world have a lot of famous people that make a lot of defferences about their life, a lot of story before they are become famous person, they all normal people just like everyone else but they just be themself so they become a different person when they planed their own way to go or to do on their life.

The world not choose you but you have to choose the world.
