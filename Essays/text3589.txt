In my opinion, The school shouldn't have to follow the model by extending the school day two hours. because schools have seven hours school day and when they use two hours for that it will be not help full for students because student. when we use the same amount of time for school that is better for me because student have more time. If we want to make our life easy or conferrable it is not help full. for example if we have a two hours expanding the school day its not helping us because the using our schedule. All school schedule is help full for all who attend the school. so we don't have to use the two hours expanding the school day. The energy of the four-day two hours extending schools extending is not help full for me so. The school follow the school management systems.

we dont have to use the two hours extending police. because,it is not help full for who attend the school and who need more time for his/her class. fore example some student need more time to do the Home work, and assignment. its not helping for that kind of student, some student need more to understand . it mean it is not help full the four-day school week and the extending the school day for two hours. Finally the am disagree with this idea its doesnt help student and teacher in the other way. school have to follow his extending police.
