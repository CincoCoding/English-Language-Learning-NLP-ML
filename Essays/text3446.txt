Conserve energy and resources,some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours because they can care about their baby and have more time for their family,Also they can have more time for all the friends, and be responsable for the house.

If they have two or more day off they would try to do somenting else.

All people need to have time for care about the family and be responsable for their child.

If we have more time with our parents so we can expend more time on our school.

Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours.

I desagree because if we have two more hours we can not have hours for study and make the thing that we want.
