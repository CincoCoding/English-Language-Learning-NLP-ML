Albert Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge."

I do agree because in your imagination you can think or do anyting you want. Knowledge is just using ur brain but it's not the same as imagination. Many people might agree with me because its just true. You can think of many ways; Therefore, all the things you think can come true but not all the time. Im going to tell you all the reason why!

Imagination is a whole new world, not many people can say that. You can create anything just by using ur brain.

In your mind think of scary movie, funny movie, and horror thing that can scare you. Sometime you can make up a plan by using ur imagination; Meanwhile, you can use ur Imagination for homework or any problem that you have at home. Think about it, you are goiign to love it.

Albert Einstein is one of the smartest people if you don't belive me read an article about him trust me. If you use your knowledge what the fun on that you can't even create nothing. Some people just say, use your knowledge for a problem instead of your imagination. knowledge is important but using your imagination is more important.

If you don't belive me belive Albert Einstien!

What would you like to use more your knowldge or your Imagination. Well think of the fun thing you can do with your Imagination. Well Albert Einstein would not have said, using your imagination is more important then knowledge. This is my opiaion but it could be your opiaion to. You need to try it, Im telling you it's so fun.

Imagination is really fun and helpfull in life; However not many people think that, Imagination fun because they never try it. Many people might think it boring and that there no point to it. But there wrong becuase how do you think that many people got out of there bubble or problem they had in school or home. Just use your imagination It might even help you in life or anywhere. Like I said this is just my opiaion no one else.
