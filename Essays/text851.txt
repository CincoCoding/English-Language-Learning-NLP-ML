I am writing to support the idea that students have to choose or identify a caree beafore they enter high school.

First of all, I support the idea on students choosing a career before they get to start high school.

That wey they will know, what they like to be when they graduate from high school.

For example some students will became profetional sport players, architects, doctors, etc.

Because thinking on becaming some one very important in the society at a young age will make them proud of them selfs, and that woul lead them in to a succesifull pat.

Secondly, for young students will be easier to get to where they want at a youn age.

Because they are young, they don't have to think a bout anyting ells but studying.

For example they don't have to think a bout payin bills, or taking care of the family.

The only thing they have to worry a bout is studying, and follow their dreams to be what they want to be.

In conclution, this are my reasons on why I support the idea that the student need to identify a career by the time they enter high school.

Thank you for your time and attention.

sincerely,
