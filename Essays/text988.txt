Hello my name is Generic_Name. Im grateful to be writing this letter to you, i hope i am fortunate to get picked to visit and learn from you and your staff. Cyber security is a career i would like to pursue as i get older, it would be a dream come true to come work with you and your staff. Being able to hack for a living would be amazing.

Cyber security interest me ever since i got introduced into hacking. I did little hacks like into my brothers computer or jail braking my phone, Little things like that. I would like to one day work for the FBI ,and help protect important information from other hackers. If i were to get selected to come visit and learn ,it would one day would help me in the future. i hope to make it big one day and hope to work along you.

It would be great to get a feel of what it would feel like to work in that environment. i wonder what it feels like is the; place quiet, what equipment do they use, how long have they been working as a hacker. Ive never visited a FBI agency, i hope i do though to witness all of you guys in action and what you do on a daily basis. This program would because it would give me an idea of the work environment so when i get older i know what im getting into. Also it would get even more motivated to wor harder every day to make it big and work with the FBI.

I would consider my self a good a focus person and most importantly i am very patient. Im a very responsible person im evan a very hard work i always try my best evan way over on what i do. Especially when it come to computer work, i have very supportive parents but in the future i would like to make good money. Nothing would make me happier then to be a hacker for the FBI for my caree, it would be a dream come true. That is why i think i should be considered to be selected to learn from you and your fellow staff.
