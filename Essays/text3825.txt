highly agree with this statment, first impression are a big thing to most peolpe because it shows them how you act around diffrent people. My experiance with first impression are quite because i get nervuos around new people, However people aren't always going to base you of there first impression of you, Even though you can't change people minds on first impressions you can still change on how they look at you later on in life, just on your behavior around them and how you carry yourself around them.

First imression are big key to finding new jobs because it shows the manager how you'll act on the job and it will tell him/her if your worthy enough for the job, sometimes first impreesion are the reason you might even get the job like my brother exprienced with his job he went to the interview with a positive atitude and went in with the mentality of getting the job, I really strognly agree with first impreesions because people really will base you on first impressions.

People first impresison on me are werid and funny, im not even that weird most of the time i dont really care about first imprssions becuase i dont base people of first expressions, i really base them on how they act after you look at them closer.
