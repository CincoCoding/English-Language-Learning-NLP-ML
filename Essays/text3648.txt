People think that working with a group is because they can talk to other more. If they work together they can talk more and joke around. The can even get lunch and hang out if they have a break time. Some people like to talk a lot and geting to know the people they work with.

If you are working with a group you can get more frends they can get more friends by talking to them. Second by doing things for them like helping them with their homework. You also ge more friends by making them laugh and giving them things.

I know it is hard getting to know people more getting to know people can be hard because some people are shy like me. It might take them a while to met new poeple. Some people just do not like talking because they can be really shy and get nervous their hands can get really sweaty.

I chose working wih a group because the benefis can help out a lot of people like me that are really shy and onse I get to know them I won't get shy as much like I use to be. Finally people are fun to hang out with like my English teacher Generic_Name she is a really good teacher and makes everyone smile and laugh. That is why I chose working with a group because people like Generic_Name can make their job fun and exiced also making it fun to learn.
