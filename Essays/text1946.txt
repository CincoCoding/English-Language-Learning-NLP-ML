This is a very good prompt to write about but i might have to agree on this becuase if you keep failing in life and sometimes you get bored of it you might have to change your mind and be success. Bacuse fialling in life is not that easy for same people. But sometimes people might disagrer it becuase if you fail you can't be successful in life, and if you are trying to get a job and you keep failing on what the boss is asking you to do you might not get the job. Even thought in school you can't keep failing.

I also agree with Churchill's satement becuase you can't just success in life without trying becuase life is evry hard to success in it. and if you wants to be success you really have to try in life, there's so many people in life that don't have job,place to sleep or food to eat becuase they did not success in life. Success also consists of going from failure to failure becuase sometimes in life you have to fail, no one in life have success from the day they were born.

My comclusion is that failure can leasd you to success.
