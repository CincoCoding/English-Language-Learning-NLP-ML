Would you like to have more time at school? I would like to have more time at school. Setting at class and learning more things. Getting work done and relaxing. I have three reason why we should have more time at school.

My first reason why we should have more time at5 school is getting work done. If theres more time at school,then theres more time to do your homework at school. Getting your homework done so you dont have to do ot at home because you finish your work at school. My reason is getting work done.

My second reason why we should have more time at school is your friends. School can get boring so thats why you have friends so you can hangout with them at school. Your friends can be your work buddy so you and your friends can work together at school so you can finish your work. You can have fun with your friends at school so it wont be so boring i school. My other reason is your friends.

My third reason why we should have more time at school is your grades. Is your grades bad? Well you can make it up because theres more time at school. If you have more work and if you get a good grade on it,the your grade will go up. Theres more time at school so you can make up work that you did bad on because theres more time at school. My last one is about grades.

So there you go,I gave you three reason why we should have more time at school. I think there good reasons. I hop you area what I wrote. If you dont area its ok. Stay in school kids.
