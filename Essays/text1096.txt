My Talent

Imagine,

having an amazing talent or skill but no one knows about it. Some people might say that hiding your talent is wrong but I think that it helps me to focus more and to develop it better. Singing is my talent , I love singing

I develop it by practicing and I use it by writing my own songs .

First of all , I love singing , my Talent, which i develop by practicing.

For example , I am always looking videos up to develop my voice and practice but sometimes I practice on my own.

The more I practice the easier is going to be for me to sing without any help, For me developing my talent is really important because my talent is my dream .

Another example is that I go to singing lessons to practice and develop my voice , sometimes they give you some notes that you can use to practice at home , with the notes they give you, your voice is eventually going to sound clear focus and mature.

Furthermore, I use my talent by writing my own songs , when I my own songs the writing will give me an extra writing skill and most of the time some old memories come back.

For instance , I usually write about my old memories , old feelings or the way i am feeling at the moment. Another instance , writing my own songs will give me an extra writing skill.

By writing all the time you learn new techniques , new ways of writing or new lyrics.

In closing , i use my talent by writing songs and that gives me extra writing skills , i develop my talent by looking up videos and by going to singing lessons . Also, my talent is my dream so i usually put a lot of effort on it .
