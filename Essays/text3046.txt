The benefits of having a good attuide is always being postive when their's a bad day, and helping others if thier having a bad day too, and just always be excited to have a postive day. For example in my life when I don't have a good morning for example like missing the school bus or having a disaggrement with my parents. I try my best to leave a smile on my face and just have a great and postive day. Another example is when I see it in other people would be just diffrent because people are diffrent and they act diffrent in every way. What I mean by that is that they can be either mad, sad, or annoyed, or just super excited to have a great day. Why I say that they can act diffrent in the morning or afternnoon is because when your going to work your maybe tired and exhasted and stayed up till like 12 AM for an asssignment for your job. Same with school. On the other hand there could be people that are super excited to have such a great day for work or school. Those people are probably really excited because maybe they finished there assingment or homework quickly. Another one is the afternoon people that come back from school or work there. Sometimes there's people that can't wait to go home and eat and see their family and just go to sleep after that. On the other hand there's some people that are so tired that they can't even drive or even talk to the person that they've been picked up by. I've seen it all from so many people. But again people are diffrent in so many ways.
