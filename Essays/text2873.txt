Based on my experiences

I agree with Emerson's statement when he said, ''Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow''. sometimes in life we have to do things that we already have mastered but it never grow. One time when was little child I learned that I can't master the things that I already have done.

For example; My brother took his master degree when he was 22 years, now he wen back to school to take his master degree again .He regret what he already took his master degree in the past and come back to take it again it did't help him it all. another example my friend decided open his old store after the government shut it down. he open store and the government came and shut it down again. I learned in this life somethings that we mastered we should leave it behind and move on to different things. I try do something I dont liked it didn't work it all but when I try work on the stuff and things that I like it works and master it no matter what the thing is. This why in life we should master the things we like and never go back to it .

While, I understand that some people disagree with Emerson's statement when he said, ''Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow'' and could be right sometimes we should master all the things we have been done in the past .

These are the reasons and specific examples why I agree with Emerson's statement when he said

''Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow''.
