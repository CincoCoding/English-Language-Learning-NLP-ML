I think that have a good attitude is great. Benefits of having a good attitude is when you, walk into school you feel ready,you don't get angry at school and don't get mad at your friends and teacher's,you always have a positive mindset when your going into school or playing a sport.

First, when i walk into school am always mad about early we wake up to go to school but i always get that good attitude when i walk so people don't see why am so mad or why am mean, i always say good morning to every teacher to make think am not going through a struggle each morning.

Next,you always want to have a good attitude with friends and teacher's and mom and dad you always want to talk nicely with friends and teacher's and always with mom and dad. You never want to say something to your mom or dad that will hurt them or make them feel bad, you see your teacher's every day and come's to school everyday to teach you something and you friends are the one's you spend most of your time with so always have a good attitude.

Finally, Have that positive mindset with every one if you don't is because you are have a bad day and you need to fix it when i play soccer i always go with feeling am going to do good score a good play good and be the best one on the team,at school you want to have a good attitude like if you have a test you don't want to say am going to fail, what your going to say is am going to pass am going to give everything i got and pass.

Concussion, i think that you should walk in to school with a good attitude even in sport's or anthing in your life becuse people are going to know you about how you are and how nice you are and how good your so always keep that good mindset about everything.
