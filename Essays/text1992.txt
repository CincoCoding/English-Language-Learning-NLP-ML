Author Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote "Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." I agree with this statement, a couple of reasons why i agree with this statement. The journy, learning new things, and the final results of what you have mastered.

First reason will be the journy. The journy will be the important part becuase its going to be the part where you will be going to grow more. The journy will teach you mastering new things therefore this brings me to my second reason the learning new things. Mastering new things will be so much help in the future. You will be able to master new things along the way on your journy to growing up more. You can never stop growing omn something you want to master. My last and final reason will be the ending. The ending is the part where you have already mastered all the new things you wanted to master on your journy. You will be able to use it any where you go, any where you are at, and with anybody.

As the ending result i totally agree with the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson about "unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will not grow." You have to still keep on mastering new things in order for you to grow more. Those are my three reasons why i agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement.
