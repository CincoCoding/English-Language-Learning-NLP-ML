I think is a good, idea that students get different types of classes because that might help to choose their career. Its a really good idea knowing what you going to do with your life once you're done with high school. There are so many teens that once they are out high school they don't know what jobs they want to start and study for it. I think that thats why they should have many more classes that thats what its going to help them continue with their thinking of what career to choose once they gradute high school. for example classes that are for automotive technology is a confortable job in a way that you learn more about cars but in a way is dangerous at the same time because cars have so many heavy parts that could injured you. Another confortable job is being a lowyer lowyers don't do much other than being in the computer or doing paperwork in that cause you dont have to be outside in the cold working on a bad job that involves working in a construction site. And thats the main idea that schools should offer carrer choices that involves students in a carreer class that will teach them once they are out school and that the jobs will interest the students. There is so many students that drop out school because is not interesting to them but thats a bad idea of not going to school because if a student doesn't graduate they will be workingfor some restaurant not earning that much money and working so many hours thats why it is important for teens to stay in school so that the school could offer them on what job they will choose once they graduate high school. School is one of the most important places where they will teach students what decisions they should take on their life once they are adults. In some cases students start going to college once they are out school because they got an idea of how their class works and what for what job they are going to study.
