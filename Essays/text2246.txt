Successes comes in so many diffrent whays,but the real questchon is how can having a good attitude lead you to being more successesful in life. I think that starts with your attitude ,attitude plays a big part in your life, for example if your about to take a really big test in math class and you tell yourself befor the teast that your going to fail and your just having a negtive attitude about it, your more likely to fail ,but if you walk into math class with a good attitude and your cofdent in yourself and your just going to give it your beast I thinkyour more likely to pass the teast.

When you think of successes you think of famos people you might think of a person on tv or someone that hass lots of money. If you think about it the people you wach on tv or any of the people you think are successesful hade to have strugled in life to get to the place they are now. What ever the strugle was they hade to get back up and push themself. There are successesful people every where fot example it could be your mom, or your dad, brother, sister any one you know. Successes doesnt have to be a big thing it could be you doing something like running a mile or being the first person in your familly to go to college or just geting all As in school Whatever it is having a good attitude in life can really change your life.

I try to be as successesful as I can if thats in school I try my beast,Whatever it is I know I cant acomlish anything without a good attitude. For example in the fuetre I want to be a fashon disinor, but that whount hapen for years but thers things I can do to push myself to the thing I want to do. Things I can do now to get to my futer ,I can start with a postive attitude There are hatters every where that try to bring you down you just have to learn how to ignore them and learn how to creat a path for yourself.
