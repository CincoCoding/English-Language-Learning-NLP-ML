Imagine you are going to buy some new shoes but you don't know if you should get them. So then you ask for some advice from family and friends. But you still don't know what to do. So then you ask for more advice. Then at last you all ready know what to do. So you can more. I think u should ask for more help and advice. so you can pick the better choices.

You can get more info on the topic you are doing. Like for one person can tell you one thing and a other person can tell you something else. Thats how you can get some more info. It helps more by asking more people because while you have your info they have there info as will. So then you can have more knoallige about whatever you doing. Last of all it's better to ask more people because like I said you can get more knoallige on the topic and will help you one making the better choices as will. It's all ways good to get more info on your topic because you don't ever want to do something with out any knoallige.

People can help you answer stuff faster. you can probably can get the answer faster by telling more then one person. like for example you are doing some hard work at school and you want the right answer you are not just going to ask one person you are probably going to ask more then one person. All really because everybody thinks different. And last of all ask more then one person can probably get you the right answer. you should other people for help.

you can help you pick the right choices. You can ask some friends or family for some help then it can help you go the right way. But if you do ask a lot of people you can probably can get confused. And maybe get mad and not finish your work. Then you will have no clue how to being aging. But all so all the opinion you got can help you a long way. Because you have gotten so much fact and options you can finish faster.

All Am saying is ask for some help and you can get the right answers and you can probably make some friends too.
