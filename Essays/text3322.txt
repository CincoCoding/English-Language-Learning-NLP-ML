Most people try to change their first impression, but the thing is they don't have a vision. Without a vision you are going nowhere, you most have a vision. Lots of people give up but I know you can do it, because failure is not an option. Always remember will is power.

Challenges are part of life, so don't see them as impossibles, but see them as oportunities. You have to work hard to reach your goal, no matter what. Keep this in mind life is not fair, so you better keep doing and don't look back of what have you done. Always have a clear vision og what you do.
