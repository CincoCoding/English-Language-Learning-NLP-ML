The great artist Michelangelo I thinking he is the best artist because he said most of us lies not setting our I am to high and falling short.

setting and achieving they work in the same position I think so Michelangelo he know that,if the achieving is low the setting low too because is the same he doing good jobs also if, he get a new jobs he had more talent.

I think the setting is too low because the system is too low so he need good system and good setting and than everything is work after than he can work very good .

my recommend to Michelangelo is change the sitting if he change the sitting for one high he need more recommendation for he jobs he need doing a lot to doing for he jobs and the setting is to short he need one bigger because the short is a lot problem.

Also I have one more recommendation if you need the new system just change is more better make sure the setting is not short because if the setting is short always are low but if the setting is bigger the setting is more high and not falling.

50% I am agree but the other 50% no

I agree because he have nice talent and he do nice jobs also I disagree because the setting is very short and low but if get my recommendation is more better and he have good idea but he have bad idea too so let me get the agree because I like he history

I agree because he used setting and achieving is two thing very important on this history he have nice history my position is when i read the history is to confuse but now i understand what he doing .

example: just change the short setting to a bigger setting if more better fr you this my litter example thank you for read Michelangelo remember dont forget my recommendation .
