Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to determine never to be idle. It's one the most important things that happen in the world,One of this was with young people, they be disrespecfull with oldes people. At this point I think everyone be agree with the statement of Thomas Jefferson.

For example, That is one of the problem that happen on many schools cause let's say when teacher tryed to explain us something about the intimate section they star to Idle when this is no funny. Also Thomas Jefferson inspire peopler to help others when they was idle to a inoccent people.

Additionaly we can stop the kind of problem if we work together helping each other.

It's wonderful if peolpe work as a community and tryed to help other,cause Thomas Jefferson was a men who like to help people on what he can. When someone else was Idle to you don't put attention and keep figthing on what you want .Like everyone know we have different talens and always one person of them was jealousy and tryed to Idle you cause he don't want you or someone else progress more them he that unfair everyone have different dreams and work hard vfor what they want.

On my opinion wse can work as a group and tryed to stop those peolpe who Idle others. Also we can do something else cause lety's said if vsomeone Idle otyhers and we bdon't help these guys the problem continued and repeat cuade anyone work with the kind of problem.

something else was some people don't like to help others. That cause that kind of problem but we as a community we can work on that and tryed to stoped.
