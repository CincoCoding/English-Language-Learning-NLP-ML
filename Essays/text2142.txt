First of all, the technology is really usefull and i think that it will have a posiitive effect in people's lives, the cuestion is how?. For example, people will not have to take a bus to visit other people, or walk miles to see other folks, instead they can just call in their phones and have a little chit chat by using tecnology.

Second, is that the tecnology can do part of the work, for example you are writing a note for a paty, ceremony, marry, whatever, and it have to be one for each person, what are you woing to do? just by using the technnology you can print evrithing you want, it makes easy your work, also have more time to do something else. In the mean time you can use your phone and unload an app to shop somthing that you like, there are several things like clothes, shoes, food, tools, and other things that can be usefull for you or you child, whatever, and there is also the app for books; people don't have to take a lot of time loking for a book, they can just find it by put it in the device or the computter

Third, some benefits of the technology is the time that you spent looking for sonthing or deciding, another benfit is the things that you can learn with all the information that is in the web, ofcourse if you use it properly like it is. You can learn how to be an artist, how to cook, and how to fix something broken.

In addition, sometimes people get addicted in a web and that could be bad, that is when the negative effecs came, people don't know what they are doing when they get adicted to it, that is why people have to know how to use it correctly

Consecuently, the technology is developing more and more, we can built great things for the future and create more, eventually, the tecnology is not the only one that is developing, there is the science too because it help to develop other things and bring protection to people.

In conclution, the technology can bring positive effects to people because is a sounce of knowledge that you can use to inprove people's live.
