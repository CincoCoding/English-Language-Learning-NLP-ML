Today in the actually there are so many things the it have be done and that we have to do, as Thomas Jefferson wrote, "Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." Imagen if all work together for a better life, that don't just benefit one persone we all get benifits of a society.

Determine our mind to don't wait intil things happen by then self we have to get ours life ready to make it happen. We have to be useful and do something for as and for others if we all work together for a better society we can do it. Imagen that stead of droing trash every time that we walk, we should peak it up make a different between this past years and now, clean our own commiunity demostrate that we can do better every day without someone to tell us what we have to do and do it.

I have seen groups of people around the world making a big difference on our planet, cleaning rivers and parks if we determine our mind to don't wait intil things happen and like those groups of peolpe make our own difference and keep do things for a better living because this all about, be useful and be better every day do something that's the key.

Do something should be a porpuse in our community, we should be more actived with thing aroud as make more difference and make things be possible. Be determine and keep doing something, do something will always be better than just wait until some do it and not do nothing. Keep it possible, productive, and wonderful
