No, I am disagree with Emerson's statement. Some people think that just because they manepulate you will change. If some elses want to make you different, or change you is because; They are not happy with theirselfs.

I think that if the people that are aroud you wants to chage you is becuase they love how you are and want to be like you ; That best thing that you can do is get away from the people and make new ones that are possive and help you to become a better person, human. The worse thing that you can do is change because of others.

People treated you bad becuase they want to accomplish their goal that is break you into pieces but, if you don't let those commen, actions hurt you everything is going to okay. Last year there were some girls that detely were hurting me my feels. In adition, Every day they would told me dress good you have to be like this act like you are a model; They would also make fun of me too because i was dressing so poorly. i was wearing the same shoes every day same pants. When they saw me they would make the face like they were going to trow up. Therefore, i never let them make my self esteem go down. I was so possitive also my family give me good vibes too, They would told me you know were you wanna get at. You know your goals those are the want you have to pay attention to.

Inconclution, don't let people make you something else. Some people think that you are going to change because they want but, they are wrong because you can be however makes you feel great with yourself. In the future i see that nobody is going to judge you.
