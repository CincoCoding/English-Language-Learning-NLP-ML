I think it's a good idea for the estudnets to commit to a career at a young age. In addiction, the students are expected to identify a career they want and use the best for them. So the students can study in higt school and select to guide them to career in specific they want.

Fisrt, In high school all the students have diffents dream on the world. Some students dream to be a Doctor, arctecture, teacher, and nurse, ect. Is a good oportunity to have a good education and a make a good person and helpfull. Then, the students can have a better life and good jobs.

Sometimes the students in young age estared to think about what carrer is better for them. Others think what career is usefull to make a good money and have a better class social. But all the students think diferent the others and we have to respet they decicion about they future.

secondly, In my opinion is is good to think or dream in biger. In my potition my family do not have all lot of money to go to the university and pay for it. For example, some of my friends are a good Doctor and arquicteture, but the thing is when they want to be a good person a get better futures on their lifes. Usually, when we think about it , but is so dificul to do it.

Thirt, students in the school have special classes to go with a career. all the people have the oportunity to think about, which want to study and where they go too. But some students cann't go to study the career they want ,because some of them have to work and pay bill in their hause. usually some of them have everything in the house and the only thing they have to do is study and make sure they work to complite all of the school and can go to study that set.

In conclution,

is a good idea to know what you want to study in young age. Also to be responsable all the things and have a great time of the life to think what is make you happy when you grew up. One day a want to be doctor of the animals. that will be make me happy.
