"Determine never to be idle.. it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing" this is what Thomas Jefferson wrote and I am totally agree whith him some peoples always are saying they can finish nothing but is because thay never doing that, never try very hard they want to stay doing nothing all the time and thats why but when you are always doing someting you finish too much like when you are doing a report work on that and you finish and adter that you can do something more and than something more and more and more but you can finished because you are doing that you no just finish your report and stop and say "ok I finish this now I can go to relax all my life" noo you work and work and for that you recieve one recompence yo don't work for nothing.

And if Thomas Jefferson says that is because is true he allways do something and he done much things he never be idle and you never had to be idle too and I think his main idea is to persuade the people too do something all the time because when people doo the world change.
