when i first came to the U.S.A

i was not able to speak English, and every time i went out to play or go to school people were showing me examples of what to do or where to do same for me if i want to go play soccer or go to the play ground ill point outside the window or draw a picture of it, i tried to come up with anther way to example what i want but examples was the only think avalibel for me until i learned English.

Example is not the mine thing in influencing others; it is the only thing because,thats the only way others will figure out what you talking about examples is what everyone use to help each other to also understand each other however,others say that example is not the mine thing to influencing other because, there are many other things to influence others for example, Google translator,Google,YouTube there is a lot of other apps that help to influence others.

i agree that Example is not the mine thing in influencing others; it is the only thing because , example is used every where and most of the time even when you want to speak to someone with another language and also kids see adult people as an example too them they see what they do and copy them example is used with everything for ex, for parents if they want there kid to be good they got to be an example of them or they have to show them an example of something or someone how to be behavior is one of the most important things because it show others hot to act and it it gives other people example of how to act in a sernat place for ex,if a kid go to a library and see tow adult being loud and playing around he going to do the same because he think that they doing the right thing because they are adult and should know how to act in place like that .

wall others say that Example is not the mine thing in influencing others because there are more thing that we can influence each others with technology made a lot for us that we can help and influence each other with other ways for ex, Google translator if i go to another country i dont need to show people examples of a museum or draw i can type it and show them or say it to them and they will give me direction and students that dont speak English can use a dictionary or Google to help them understand.
