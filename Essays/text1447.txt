I agree with the author Ralph Waldo Emerson, because is important to be a yourself in the world for the example, in my case is very cool be writer is constantly trying in the world. In th worl needs people like auhors.

In the world needs very much people where exist much writers, and having books for to read, all needs books about the inspirations like people, for example like be yourself is luris be unique.

I want to be someone else they don't like to much think in yourself just what they want.

In the else of the jobs, if you try to be yourself and the built the company want you will never fine the happen to me a lot of time, when try to apply to a job they want you altogether with different expresion like: Happy, active, team work, and accurate.

I agree too with Ralph Waldo Emerson with this theme "to be yourself in a world is constanly triying to make you something else is the greastest accomplishment."

This theme is for to learn much are sentences small but is interesting are word for go ahead, for demontrate a good energy a all person that feeling of be yourself is a theme muy interesting like my person is a segment that transmit securiy, and joy in we soul.

is like for example that persons that feel less than that other person this is a agurmen or texbook like this transmit good vibes a that person.

Exist person that don't like understand because they don't care this theme they want cell phone, video game, and all insignificant over there take a very bad conduct the person having that to read, to learn, to listen, to silence, after to know they have to help and counsel.

The life is a circle when all people have to learn, to living, of good form.
