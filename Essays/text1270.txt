I think i agree on the Churchill statement because :

every time you failure more and more ,every time you learn something new , for example :

my mom always puts me to clean the house but every time i went to do the cleaning, she used to say "you din't clean here or "you are missing a part of the floor that still is dirty" so i just say to my self next time i'm gonna clean better in this part of the room and i keep smiling not given up.

To learn how to clean the house in a perfect way i decided to clean the house every Saturday so i can practice more , it passed two month and then i went to clean again and i mop the floor , clean the windows , clean all the tables,so i finished and my mom says great job you now know how to clean in a perfect way!!.

remember to success you don"t even have to think about what you do wrong just keep working on it ,and keep dreaming!!!
