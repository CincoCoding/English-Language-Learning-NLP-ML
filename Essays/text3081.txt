The school day should not be extended even more and I dont want the be their for an extra hour and i dont think anyone else would want to be their for an extra hour. Reason one we are in school almost all day 8 hours is enough there is not way i'm staying their for an extra hour. Reason two staying in school an extra hour is less time to do our homework and they give out a lot of homework,we will probably be done with homework by bed time. Reason three with more school hours,less homework time,less free time. We wont have any time to do what we want because they give out a lot of homework witch means we have to put in more time on home work and we have to stay in school for an extra hour also means more homework time and way less free time. thats why we should not be in school for an extra hour because we are in school almost all day,less time to do our homework,even less time for free time.
