From my view point im really sure that never would be possible to change it , because there a fiew factors that cannot make that possible . People can not forget the first impression they have from you . i went to play soccer a few years ago it was my firts time, that day i was knowing too many new people from every where around the world.

We were played soccer and they told me that i'm so good for soccer they like the way that i play it. Now every where when they see me they say to me '' hey you play really good for real ''. so here is the conclucion. People never going to forget the firts impression that they get from you those people still remember me the time goes fast i didtn meet them for a year and half and the impression still stay that they think that im really good for soccer .Some people say that impression can be change not matter if is good or bad impression but you gotta work really hard for it and its going to take a long time.
