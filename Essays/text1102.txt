Everyday everbody try to do the best to live that day happy and try to make somebody also happy, for example when i was in Italy every year for the day of god everbody going to downtown and have some fun together like they drink,talk,eat and eat again, you can have some much fun there with no money the with money. This is important because you don't need money to be happy in your life just live your life with people the make you feel good and don't try to make you feel sad or bad.

In your life Don't follow nobody and don't trust no one just your self. For example do somethiing the you like and you need think about the you are better the everyone because some people in this life are jealousy and something they can break you dream and you can not follow your dream because he say someting the make you sad or he do someting to you the you feel the with the thing the he did you can stop follow your dream. This is important because Don't live somebody also your life and don't make someone also control and tell you what you need to do with your life.

Everyday I

think about world can be if everyone are able or think to help the next youth. For example one day I was in Italy I was going to the super market with my dad and i think was my friend too with I don't know wherever, we going t obuy all the food the we need and when going to the register to pay what we buy I saw a guy try to buy a sandwich but he tell the register the only money the he have was $0.50 cent the sandwich was i think $2 then when i saw him turn the sandwich back to the register I take the sandwich and I buy for him, he was so happy and he tell me," My friend you make my day better" i was so happy that day. This is important because you don't need spend a lot of money to make someone happy.

In conclusion I think we are complish more when we always do something for somebody and I want say to everone the to live your life and never give up, because the time the you give up iss when you not trust your self anymore and that's is not a good thing.
