Technology has given us humans positive and negavtive effects in life. For example Bullying is serious and negavtive effect on us, Bullying isn't just physical contact there is cyber bullying and that's were the technology come in. Another negative effect that technology has given us is No Contact, The new genration does not have contact as like people would have had before. We need contact becuase it shows that we can work with people and it also shows that we are social.

One positive thing about technology is new research for example now a days we can just go on google and search up things we might need help with, For example if you are confused over a topic or you want to know a little bit more about it you can just go on google and search it up. Another positive effect technology has given us is Locations, Locations is a part of everyday's life for example if you need to go somewhere you can just go on your phone and search up the name of the place where you want to go. Technology is something we need now a days because there's creations all over the world being created everyday.

Human contact is what we expect but now a days we can't find that because it either go on snapchat, instagram, or add a friend on facebook even adults do this not just kids and teens. Human contact is something that we need everywhere in life we need these things at work,school,sports teams and more. So human contact can be limited now days but there isn't any change becaue more and more techonlogy keeps coming towards our way and we can't stop it.

In conclusion this is what I think about technology ive given positive and negative feed back about technology on human contact.
