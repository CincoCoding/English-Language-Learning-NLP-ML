Dear principal today i would like to write about the plans that the school have with lunch food, I have hear form many students about the school food lunch chaging many students are disapointed and others aere happy for the news, My self personally I have my on opinion that I would love to share with you about this topic.

In my opinion I think it would be great for the health of the school and student to have a healthy food during school hours, one main reason is bacause it keep our body,healthy strong in which we can reflex our education, It will benefit all the students mainly the ones that are in PE class,eating healthy can improves more day of life and better human body, eathing halthy can prevent you from disease and probably some virus.

by eathing healthy you will not only will be able to be on a good fit you can also feel good and with feeling good about your self means more thant anything in this world, my opinion about this i agree with this change and i would like to see more plans for the upcoming futre years.

every plas have good and bad opinions many student at school have said and have their own opinion, Many of them dont like to eat halthy they just wnat to eat and enjoy their life at the fullest, which is reasenable and i undestand they point, we all know that the food that make our body get fat and get worse is the bad type food but we all love that kind of food, is delicius and it taste great for example pizza, hamburgers and all those kidn of food.

To keep a balance and for the students to be better and feel better about them self i think it will be the best to have a schedule of food for example :monday healthy food, Tuesday bad food...

In my opinon i thik it will be the best for our students and for everyone in the school to have a healthy food schedule that way we can be happy and satisfy with our body. I agree with the plan of replacing the school food for a healthy kind of food. thanks for all your pation and i hope you like my opinions and you could consider this on your future plans.
