The school ends at 4 o'clock and most of the students arrive and home 4:30 pm. I disagree to change the time of the school because the school ends at 4 pm and if one and half hour more the student will arrive home at 6 o'clock. The student need some time to study for test and do there homework. The homework and the test will take them 2 hours. Mae by there grades are low and he or she want her grades not to be low he or she will do extra study for 30 minutes. The total time is for studying is 2 hours and 30 minutes and that is 8:30 pm. If he or she want to go out side to play she can't. Know whey his or her parents dose not allow him or her to go out side Intel they do there homework. If you dont Chang the time him or her can go out side to play.

The students will school all gloomy or tared because. gloomy because they did not go out side because the school board change the time and they won't considerate on there study and the students pr antes will be upset form the school because of the time that school board changed. Tared because of the time the won't considerate on studies pr antes will be upset because of the time.

if you don't change the it will all batter full consideration and no glommynis. The students will get to play out side with there frindes no complantes from the parents. Student will get sleep. So you should not change the time.
