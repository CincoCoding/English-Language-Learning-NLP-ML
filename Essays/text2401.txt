I do agree with Prime Minister Winston Churchill. My first reason is because most of the people in this world will think that is really easy to be successful, but time will get difficult as you and your self are growing up, for you to be failing over and over again is just a meaning that life at some point will be easier, Most people if they keep failing they won't know what to do, Keeping your hope and thoughts on your mind that's how you will succeed. keep on following that dream no matter how hard time will. Sometime you will feel like you're not getiing answer or at least a signal.

My second reason is that failure is going to come at some point in your life for example; teenager come at school, adult come at work, money wise, housing. failure is something that we all should learn how to over come that problem we should think for a solution make a plan in our life. how are we goinf to fix this part and find a solution to over come that problem if we need help from somebody.

My third reason is that as soon as you over come failure you start learning thing about themselve, that they didn't know before, most people find ways to stop going back failing, that's when you start gaining the believe on keep going on practicing every single method to do not fail again.

In my conclusion most of the people have those hard time and is bext to talk to someone about a look for answer, in way to find the solution and fix this problem by yourself or with someone important in your life.
