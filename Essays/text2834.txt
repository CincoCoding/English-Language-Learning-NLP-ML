Sometime in life , if we dont try new stuff, we will never succeed. The author, Ralph waldo Emerson wrote," Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow", and i agree with him.

Sometimes in life to succeed , you have to be passioned.

If you are passioned, you will be better at everything that you do, also, we have to be passioned to look for new stuff that you will like to know more about and learn about it.

If you want to grow in life , you can't be scared,

sometimes for being scared of learning or asking a question, we miss big opportunities and stay stuck, also, dont be scared of what other people think about you.

Other people might say that if you are good in life right now , why would you want to learn something new?, and you have tell them that you want succeed in life,be better person, not like the average people that dont do nothing to be better in life.

Many times to grow and succeed in life, we have to try new things, we cant be stuck in the same thing for our whole entire life. The statement that Ralph waldo Emerson wrote, is very true and i agree with him, if we dont try new stuff , we wont grow in life. we have to be more passioned of our life and start looking for new stuff to learn, and stop being scared of learning because we are missing big opportunities.
