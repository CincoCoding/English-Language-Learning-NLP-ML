The author who wrote this line was very smart based in the life actuality the people when say, " you will never grow" I'm agree with the author I think in this world some people not are conform with the that have. However the problem is that some people are avaricious, think that are better that others people and want all at the same time.

The first reason is that some people are avaricious, is a bad influence for the people that want grown in the jobs, school and in the milieu family, for example my brother not finish the school, Because He like the money and He think the best solution will be leak of the school for work more and have more money. And now He say that is not good idea leave the school for money.

So they's think that are better that other people, for the society cause indifference to the other people, rejection would be also bulling. I am disagree with the thought of this type of people for example, if she/he can make something grand also the other people can the major greatness is the humility.

The third reason is want all at the same time, when the author talk about "you will never grow." Is because the knowledge of the life is not obtain things materials amount, because in this life all is vanity if you want grow start for conform with the little that you have for example, the education help for that you will be a good person with principles.

The conclusion is that the life have many opportunities bad you have the option take one opportunity. For that you can grow and can be a good person, and be intelligent because the vanity is bad adviser.
