A Former British Man a Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ''

success consists of going from failure to failure wi t hout loss of enthusiasm

.''

is like saying that people are more afraid of success that they're are in failure. what Winston is talking about that is okay to lose once in awhile as long you have that smile in your face that you already a winner of yourself, like playing a soccer game but your team loses but you lose as a team, failing a quiz you just gotta do better in the retake you can't give up on something that is precious to you. People make mistake and people learn from it just try to do better next so you can succeed on winning. Some people are scared to take the chance to succeed because that taking a risk of failure and people have but you won't know if you try. Winston Churhill want people to never give up on your dream. if you learn more about the subject you won't got no worried about a thing. Once I was little I have a hard time learning and participating in class that my mother and father didn't knew about the time that they constant working to provide us a house,food,and clothes. I have to restart kindergarten because of my failure that I didn't bother asking my mother about was my mom knew about they took me to a doctor to check on me that I have a learning factor my mother was worried that I have to transfer every school that have a program for me then there was one school that help me learn better communicate with teacher answering question when I first started highschool I look back when I was little and started to laugh and think I have so many chances to succeed in life that one day I'll go back to the teacher and say thank you for everything so I have to go through of failing but never lose my hope of becoming a winner.
