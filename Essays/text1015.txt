A science experiment is enjoyable and educational because you are in a group some times and you are have fun and you are learnig new stuff. Other school subjects should do that because people pay more attention to it nobody likes having a teacher sit there and give you a packit to learn nothing all day. Science expreiments are the best because you see whats happening and your getting it more. It makes it better to get a hands on activty then just looking at a book all the time. I feel like more people have As than Fs in science because the experiment helps people alot. Over all its just a better than to do because helps peoples grade helps them understand what they are trying to teach them.

I personally like science expreiments more than any other classs becasue it helps me have an A in that class. Other people like it because people in my scince class always get happy when the teacher says we do have an expreiment to do. Overall i feel like expreiments are more educational and fun activtys
