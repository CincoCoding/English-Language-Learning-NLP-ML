Do you think that students are allow to visit workplace. If companies allow students the would be expert at there job if the visit the workplace the would know where the think are and if you are the employer you would be firmer with the new worker at the job.

I would like to work at a companies because there you can work with more than one worker and have your owed offiest and you can be doing work with you worker and get help if you need help from your workers and If you allow me to visit it can be change in your companies.

Allow students to visit can help your partnerships with schools and students minet work at your companies or organizations companies can get a lot of help from students if the allow them to visit some companies need a good idea if you lant students visit the can give some good ideas for your companies and you organizations.

Why I chose working for a companies is because I like to talk with other workers and have fun while I am in work and I like working with others so this the best job and the best chose for my companies to chose me.

student like to be with there friends at work so this is the best job for the student that like to be with the friends at work and have fun if you have a group of friends this minet be the best job for all of you.

Local workplace is for you if you don't have group of friends

I chose this job for this reies. Companies should allow students to visit the companies or the job you with to work for all the jobs sould allow students to visit it. but some of the job are dgerast.

I need to pass
