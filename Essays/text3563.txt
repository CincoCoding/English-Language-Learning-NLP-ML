Disney land is the place I would want to explore! Have you ever heard the saying " Disney land is your land?'' Well I would like to explore the nights with marvelous fireworks,and blasting shows. Disney land is a great place, for kids that enjoy watching Disney movies and/or shows.

At Disney land kids would enjoy the shows,fireworks,and rides! A family would see the look at their kids face after a fantastic night of fireworks mashed up with fantastic plays. Therefore, I would like to go out to Disney land to view the huge castles with decoration ,and visible lights that would just glow my night up!. In sum, Disney land would be my elected place because I love, and enjoy watching Disney shows, and love to see people act out as Disney characters.

In additional, Disney land is my dream place to go because I get to watch my favorite shows, and enjoy myself! However, my way of explaining Disney land is... Imagine yourself playing your favorite sport or your favorite hobby. In this example i'll be using hockey. Lets say you just love being offense since your really good at it, and always help your team to win with your blossom hits. Therefore since you would love hockey (defense) ,and I love watching plays both would connect to form a connection which would be a joy of winning in hockey ,and a joy of watching people preform plays. In conclusion you love to play hockey, and I love watching plays which all leads to a great night of our favorite shows/sport in a optimistic way that will be unforgettable.
