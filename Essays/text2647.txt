High School

Regular high school is 4 years 9,10,11,12 grade for graduate. But students can graduate and 3 years some school has a programs that allow high school to graduate in three years,

this programas has three opcion for gradute in three years. The first opcion is summer school the scond opcion is evenings school and the last opcion is do not take any elective courses.

My first reason, why i think is better finish high school in three years for students is because all of the students high school are teenager and they need time for do stuff. So why i think is good idea finish high school in three years is because they could be take drive licenses, insurance, all stuff they need.

My second reason, is because all of the students are teenager, and some working for save money for college. If they can finish high school and three years they can working one year and same money for collage.

My third reason is because all the students who follow this programs could be more opcion for find a good college , and find a good place for live close of the family and find a good job.

conclusion.

I think this programs are good opcion for students who want going to college.
