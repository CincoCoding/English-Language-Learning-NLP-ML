Do we choose our own character traits?

As the British naturalist and politican Jonh Lubbock wrote, "Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it." I certanly agree that everyone is capeable of choosing their own character trait, they are independent enough to have control over themselves', they're capeable to choose in what type of enviroment they want to be in, or how to react to bad or good circumtances, at the end of the day we all have the freedom to choose who, and what we want to be.

Jonh Lubbock wrote, "Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.' everyone have the completly control over themselves, no matter how bad the circumtances may be or how tough a problem is, everyone will always be allow to choose either to smile or cry, to be positivee or negative for example;

My grandma, she's a 78 years old lady that have work her entire life, she's a very independent women who always says, "If i don't do it, no one can make it as good as i can." Always with a positive attitude, never sitting down, because she says that sitting down is a waste of time, and she have always been so energetic, until one day that sadly she had a really strong stroke in the middle of her brain that made her lose movement on half of her body, and her voice, her doctor told us that she was going to stay in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, it was hard to see someone so positive and with so much energy, in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, everyone was really shock and depressed about it including my mom, but even though my grandma knew what was going on her positive attitude never change, she took over the circumstances and she never gave up on herself she decided to be "positive", even though it was a rough time in life, this example helped me to see that everyone have their own control or they can choose who they want to be in the hard or easy times.

Everyone can have the freedom to choose the enviroment around them, how they wanna live, with who they wanna leave, people have the abilitly to understand when there are toxic people around them, to understand how much an enviroment can change the way they act, to understand that they can change the negative enviroment into a positive enviroment, everything in your character depends on your onw person, yes the enviroment that is around you can affect a lot on your character, affects on what you do in a daily base, but at the end of the day it alwasy depends on you, who you wanna be, who the people around you should make you feel, and how positive or negative it should be.

Having a reaction with other people around you can show them what your character is, it can show people your weakest part, and can shows them how dangerous or calm you can be, reactions are a really big part of our characters either if we have the control of them or not, how we react and how we respond depends on us, for a lot of people having their own character it's really hard, because of their negative or positive mood, sometimes we want to be or act like other people that we see at school, but that's like stealing their characters, at least but not last everyone have the freedom to choose what their character traits are or can be.

In conclusion everyone is free to choose what they character should be, no matter if they are going through a rough time or have the whole word agains them, theywill always have the chance of trying to be someone else character or build their own, but it will alwaysbe what they choose their character traits to be.
