In the this world everyone have twenty-four hours for one day. What are you doing for a day? Do you accomplish something? Everyday you want do somthing, maybe you are inactive. sometime you do this thing, and you want to other thing on the same time.

I am a student sometime I have had homework to do. Determine never to idle? For example; After school, I need thoughtout I have project to do, I want to relax do nothing, and I want to eat dinner. Is it struggle in the my mind. Which I want to do first? If I finish my project, after the time, I can to want I want to do ,is purpose for a day.

My position is if I always focus one thing, I will cacccompish more. If I am idle, it is waste my time, and I can not to my purpose. You do anything have had process. Never have idle for life? I think maybe, but I feel is impossible, because you can be idle, this is your life, you can decide idle or completely do something.

I believe doing something you like, you are quick accomplish. If I have some problem thing, on the idle time, I can think about find some solution. Think about how I can to my purpose. When you be to purpose, I will wonderful done much to do. Life is your what is want to do, do more? or idle for time?
