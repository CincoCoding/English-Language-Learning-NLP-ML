Dear sir:

It is wonderful how much may be done if we always doing.'' But i think we always need i break during our activity and work, when we work alot we can't make all dreams true, but remember that we something have a family and this can't cause family problem, if you are not expent time with them.

During work time all the employee has to have break . because the help everybody, to have a good mental work in their job. no break during work time, can't cause bad discuss, bad service bad comunication with all constumers, family problems.

Break can't help the empoyee to be good at work, and the way we can't have a good comunication with everybody and also with all constomers.

And also if you have family, you can't prevent problems problems with them too

. Sometimes some people work alot but they forget that they has a family in home waiting for them, that's why alot of people divorse, because they don't have a good cominication.
