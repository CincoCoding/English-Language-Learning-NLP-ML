People talk more then one person because they may need help and solve the problem. They will make a better choice what will they do and not doing bad choice like, staling money, selling drag. A advice can help people make other people do the right thing.

Just one people can not make a good choice but more people can. People can choice their opinion for what thing can make then better. They can take ideas. If they talk only one that not a good advice. For a examples if you have a math problem and you use only one idea and that a hard one, use other choices that will help you. If you did not pick a idea it will be hard and you will fail. Pick the best that work for you, and that how advice work so people can make better choice like picking the right for them. A example when kids not follow the direction, they need to make a idea for better choice at school and that how advice work. If like what the rules for the class and list thing so you can make the classroom better and safe.

For not follow the direction and not make good choice can lead problem. Kids need advice too. Sometime people can make silly choice like selling drag or taking money on someone. Advice could be safe too. So those people need advice for what can happen and what the better things. But people don't allow talk to more then 1 people they can talk to one people if they feel good about. But when people don't really make good choice they need more then 1 person. For example if their was a bad guy and he keep staling money he need the better thing so a he can make a better choice so that how advice works. Advice does'n mean bad people do it and can be good people even kids because kids sometime do silly and act bad at school.

Advice is a good thing to make choice and it good for school so kid can make better choices. It like rules and need to follow, so that how advice work.
