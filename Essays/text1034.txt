First, i would say i agree with most of the student that they are intersting to finish their high school in three years,and in my opinion that is good for them so, they can have more years for college and some of the students have to do that to graduate early for example, i am one of them i have to finish the high school in three years because when i came to united states i came too old and i didn't take the freshman year in united states that is why i have to graduate in three years.

Most of the students are preparing for good colleges and some of the colleges you have to stay so many years to finish them. and also from my experinse it is hard enough as it as in four years but i know so many students have done it before and they sucssed on it. and i know some student have done it too but in 2.5 years. and i almost have done it and it have been good for me but it need alot of work and you have to study hard and foucces in your school and do your homwork and get good grades and don't do any pronlems in school becasue if you did any thing wrong you are going to stay more years at the school.

it is good to graduate early whenn you are young so you will have alot of years in college to be a heigher education. at the end i would say and support every one that want to graduate early because it is good for their future and i have to say thank you for the people that they are helping me to do that.
