Do you think is good idea for student to finish high school in three years?

most in one point is good bad in other point is not really good because when a student take the four year of high school is most be prepared, when someone took three of school is not on total prepared.

Most kids wants take three year but they don't thinking about it; they think is easily for them. Take time and thinking, most student who follow ths plan most don't take elective classes courses for the simple act that finish high school early then other students.

Kids who finish high school, in four year they're going with knowledged that they know better than other, some high school's have programs three year until two years to study, but in some high school's it is necesary make four years for wherever reasing or for that is traditional four years as well one motive is because student after graduate they will go to work they don't go to college and that's why they took three years.

For example one's of my friend's took three years and her sister took two years my friend's who took three yaars she said that her don't have the opcion to take elective classes for the simple reason that her will graduate in three years from high school. But when she took one career of college she don't what is going on, because one of her classes has nutrition wellnes and she didn't know nothing about it.

Her sister took two classes her only have three clases; crime, cooking, and goverment;

and her teacher says that her want the opportinity of wanted to comes night school for finish the three classes, but she graduate beginig of time, her graduated in march that normal graduate for us is in june.

But if some high school offer that program is subs to you is good to take just three years, but is oportunity take four years to graduate from high school. Most studen follow that opportunity three years to graduate because they want enter the college early or work.
