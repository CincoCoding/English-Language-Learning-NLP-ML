How technology can effect people's live or human contact?. I agree, because technology is not the best thing human created. Sometimes people say, "technology is bad because effect the family can't be together" or just they don't like the technology. I feel when people say that, is because they know technology effect people's lives. This are some reasons how technolohy can effect people's live or human contac. Peolple be adictive with their phones, They can be adictive with shopping online, and don't have communication with other people.

The people is adictive with his phone or the game, in my opinion is bad because they just thinks in his self. For example, if someone need help he or she can help the person because, he or she are used the phone and sometimes mean, their phone or the game is more important that someone need help. That person can be a adult or a child. Sometimes we need to be more kind an have a good heart with other people.

I know is you are woman, you always shop online that is the best thing make womans. but some of woman have addiction with shop online. For example, some of woman shop online and that good because you can be indepent and shop you own clothes, others shop a lot clothse and they have big addiction with shop online.

I my opinion the person don't have communicate with other people, is a person don't that ispiration for his life or future. For exmaple, if that person never do something that motive or that is good for that person, literally he or she is one of more.

In my conclusion, we nedd to be a ligth between that people is addictive in their phone. Because that bad for they life and their future. That was I agree, because technology is nor the best thing human created.
