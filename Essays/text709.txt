Conserving energy and resources, this is what the most part of the society is worried about, some bussineses are even adopting a four-day work week, each day consisting of ten hours; but should schools apply this model by extending the school day two hours? Well, I belive that schools should adopt this model because: It gives students a longer weekend to vacation, or simply to their favorite activities, second reason would be learning part, students will have a longer period of time for each class, which means they can learn farter, or memorize it easier; then we have the most important; the resources and energy saving.

Almost every student loves to have a loger weekend, one example could be my neightbor Generic_Name; he loves to go camping on weekends, sometimes he tells me, he wish to have a longer weekend, that would allow him to go even further or simply to stay loger at the same place, I am pretty sure that the three days weekend would make him happy, others may also be thankful, because they will have more time to do their homework or just to study. Me, as an example, I rather to stays at home and study; sometimes, I feel like the weekend went off a lot faster than the usually.

The second reason, which is so important for students, I belive it is; the longer classes that we will have, this will make a great impact on the grades of the students, longer classes will make us learn quicklier,Generic_Name my brother is one of those student that forget some important things about any class, I always tell him, "Generic_Name study, do your homework," and he has already forgotten what the homework was about, I belive Generic_Name will get better and remember the homework with the loger period of classes; also in my class of science, sometimes the whole class is experimenting with some wird liquids, and we are still mixing when, the bell rings, my theacher, Generic_Name, says, "it would be greatful, if we would have more time so we would be able to finish the experiments," and of course! the entire classe agree with what he says.

Some people might say that students would forget somethings during weekend, however the four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources; there is a massive wave of air polution in this world, and one of the biggest is fosil fuel, millions of kids are dropped to school by their parents, if we start coming to school a day less; it would casue a great impact over the polution, it could reduce polution a lot, also the government will save a lot of money in terms of food sources, every day, schools give tons of food just for students, a non-classes friday could help to save that much resources.

As a conclusion, I belive schools should adopt this four-day school week because; it will make students to enjoy the new schedule, the three-days weekend, this will give more time to do our favorite activities or to study. It will also give us longer classes, where we could have bigger activities without being worry about the time, at least not as much as before, but it will be enough, and my last one which I belive the most important, society will have less air polution, and also the the government will save a lot of money if we get the four-day schoool.
