One small acts of kindness can help other people by doing little things for them. Helping people with a small act of kindness is helpful because they probablly have never ever gotten a sweet thing said to them or something kind to them. Anybody should be kind to one to the other because it's something kind to do. It can have an impact in others because it can litterlay change the world by being kind to another. The reason why it could change the world is that people in this world don't care to be kind but if everybody does it then it would change by alot.

Just by saying something kind to someone could make someones so happy thats why doing something kind no matter how small it is, it could make someone really happy and amazed and if a person could treat someone like that there is a possibilitty that they could do it to other people and the kindness could go around. Kind is what a alot of people need and its somethimg great to do. You can impact someone by saying something really simple but all of it with kind. In my opinion i think that kindness is a wonderful thing and i can believe that its a huge impact for others.
