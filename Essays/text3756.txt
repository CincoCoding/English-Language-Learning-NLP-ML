Do you think a positive attitude is the key to success in life?

in this paragraph, i will say that I'm agree to have a positive attitude beacuse it's a good thing and important that people should have.

One reason why have a positive attitude, it's beacuse if you give a positive attitude to one person, that person will be nice to you, and you going to receive all the things that you want, and like you want to be, and that person going to give you back the same attitude to you, that means that if you give a positive attitude you goint to receive a positive attitude.

Another reason, is that people should always have a positive attutide to every single person, so the persons can be nice to you, and treat you like you want, and that can demostrate that you are a good person that have a possitive attitude.

Last reason, have a positive attitude always going to be a important and good thing, beacuse it's help you, that how can be nice to the people, and when you give a positive attitude to one person, and that person give back to you, it's feel good, beacuse they treat you very nice, they smile to you they ask how is going, that's the positive attitude.

in conclusion, have a positive attitude is the key to succes in life.
