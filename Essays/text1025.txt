I beliece that high school students, shouldn't and should commit to just one career. My first reason that they shouldn't is that the students can change want to do as a career. My first reason why that thwy should is that this we don't need to go colloge if we are studying the class in high school. My other reason we should is that it good to now about that career you want to do in the future. For an example like JROTC is an amzing thing it shows about how militray life is going to be if go throw that path. A other example is AOL it shows a care you want to learn about like becoming a firefighter and more like that. A other great expame is a career for a day. So those are great explames to help students unstand that career more in deafeth. My other reason why we shouldn't is that this high school we are speacking about we don't have to chose just one career and stick with it. But lastly it's your chose go to a school that does makes you do that or not do that!
