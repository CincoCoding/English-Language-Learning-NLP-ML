What i would like to accomplish right now i guess it would be my grades. because they are not good im not doing good at any clases that i have right now. my grades are bad and one thing i would like to accomplish right now i guess is my grades for the moment because now i feel that im going to fail all my test. that im having right now im failing all the clases and i guess that's the only thing i want to accomplish for the moment i still have time to learn and study for my all my test that are coming this year hopefully i can do good. last year i did my writing ESOL and i didnt pass the test but i got the maximun number so i can retake the test again and that time i didn't did good a fail the test i didn't know how i did the first test that i got 385 on my ESOL. then i fail when i was going to retake it again i know that i did my best that time but i stil ask my self how i fail it again i even stay after school so i could retake the test again i guess that time i was lucky. that day i guess i didn't study well i guess because this time i didn't pass it or because i was doing the test fast and i couldn't read the test or i just didn't care about it.
