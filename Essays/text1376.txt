i don't agree whit considering changing school policy so that student may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average because getting a B in all classes is going to be hard everybody love to play sports o other activities.a gree whit you if you put that the student cut play sports or other activities if they have lice a C.because is going to be more easy for them to get a C+ than a B because you tiring see in which class they need to have a B for the y cut play sports or other activities.

so that mean that they need to have in all the clases B for they cut play sports or other activities.i don't agree whit you because is going to be hard for them to get a B for that they cut play sport or other activities and many of the student have C on there clases,they are going to pase whit C they are doing a good jod in class.in me opinion,i see that i let the student that have C,B AND A to play sports and other activities byt the students that have D and F they cut not play in sports or other activities because there are feling the year and if why leat them play so they are not going to do good in class for that they cut pass the year.that is why i don't agree whit your idea because if they have C is fin they are pasing the year but the students that have D and F they are not pasing.dos are the students that you need to see that if they don't have C or B they cut not play or participate in sports or other activities.your adia is good but like those student that have c they are doing all that they can to pass that years and is not fear to them that they are doing all that they can to get a C and that you see that they need to have a B for that they cut play sports or other activities.finally,i don't agree because is not going to be fear for them that they get C on there class and you set that they cut not play sports or other activities because they don't have B.
