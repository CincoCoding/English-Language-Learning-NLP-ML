Studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start an after school homework club. Do you think its a good idea to start an after school homework club? I think its a great idea let me tell you why its a good idea.

First you can get help with your work. the teacher can help you if you dont understand your work. If your having trouble with your work the teachers or students can help you and they will show you how to do it. The teachers will explain how your making mistakes. some students may not have a good home and the may not be able to complete there assignments because of the fact that they dont have supplies to complete there work so the teachers and students can help the student who needs help.

Second many students get low grades due to incomplete homework. In the club the students complete homework then turn it in the next day. students will turn homework in on time everyday. Students can work on classwork, projects, and homework. students can complet homework early so they will not do it on the last day.

Finaly other students can volunteer to help students. Students can get rewards for helping others. students can particpate for class grades. Both students learn from working together. They learn there mistakes and correct each others papers.

In concluson i think starting an after school homework club is a good idea heres why. You can get help with your work and many students will not have low grades due to incomplete homework. Other students can help students who need help with there work. as you can see thats why i think its a good idea to start a homework club.
