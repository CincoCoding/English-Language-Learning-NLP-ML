The first impression is always imposible to change; I agree with this statement because most of the time people judge on youas you look and it is always on the mind of the person for example:

the kind of clothes that you had been dreessed, the way that you speak and the face expression of that person.

As, peopple dreessed define their personality. If you have requiered to atttend to a meeting at work with the bosses of your boss, and dressed that is neccessity its not appropiated, they may judge on you and they could said that you are not a proffesional worker, or a formal person.

To get full attention people forgat a good value adecuated at the time of wave, meet, and speak with the other person. One reason is the major or important for people, and is the way the people communicated with others always matter because represent they selfs.

The expresssion with the face when someone meet others for the first time is never forget like when they heard your name, even the smile of the person most of the case represent the character of a person.

All of all, the way that you present with others at the first is how you are going to be remember, but are we good judgen people only for the first impression that we made about it?.
