I agree with Thomas Jefferson that we can accomplish many things together. In many cases people are in active and they lose a lot opportunities. It is better to be society, fight for the benefits and to be .an active person. This can change many things in people's lives.

We have to be society to not procrastinate about daily tasks. If we are always participating and if we are always involving ourselves in an event or task that is beneficial to oneself or other. It helps build a sense of standards for society and also builds up a persons attitude

Accomplishing something does not always mean achieving a goal, it could also be perform regular tasks with the best benefits.

They have to fight for benefits what they want and no waist any opportunity. In my case i am always an inactive person and lose a lot of opportunity along the way. The opportunities I had and i lost because i am an inactive person and that's bad.

It is better to fight every day to achieve the things we want in life. With the thing that i had to past is better to fight and strive to be successful.

Active person can help people reach their goals, It feel good help people and use time wisely. In this world people have big goals in order to reach these goals people need to work for them. Small action like help or participating in community people take that like a big change in society. Time is limited in a day people use this time to accomplishing they goals. Being in active person can change the world and make a difference.

In conclusion it does not matter who you are but we have to be sociable. to meet the goals and have benefit with the things we want and fight for the things we want to achieve in life. And do not waste any opportunity and also help those who need it to be a better person.
