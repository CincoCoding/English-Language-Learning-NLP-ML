No i do not think that we should add one hour and a half to school. I think it is bad anough that we have to stay for about 7 hours i have a lot of reasons why i think they should not add an hour to school. One of the reasons i would not want them to add an hour to school is because if they add an hour to school they would have to add class to the chool to. but one of the main resons that i would not want another hour at school is becuase kids just want to go home and adding an hour would just get kids and parents mad for there kids getting home late.

For example if it was day light savings time it would be very dark once every one to go home. Or if a teacher staff memeber or student plays a sport they would be late or unbkle to go for the late releas at the school. In addition if there where to be a lockdown at that hour and a half that the school bored had added the parents of the students might want to sue the school bored for putting there children in danger at the time they added to the day. Another example is if ther is a fire they could get sued for the same thing that is why i feel like the school bored should not add an hour and a half to the school day.
