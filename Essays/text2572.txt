Dear Mr Manager

I would like to work at Outback Stake House, and I just want to say your food is amazing and I just want to work there because im really interested. And I know I will start low but I want to billed my way up to the cook, and I was wondering if it would be OK to visit and take a look at the resteront and see where is everything like a meeting. And the time where I am available is Saturday, wendsday, or Thursday if thats OK with you. My plane is to work there until im done with high school and after that I will go to college, but while I am working there I want to please the customers so they can come back again,and I just want to work hard and get promoted. And the reason why I would like to work there is you pay good money and I just really like that resteront itself and it would br new for me. And ya that is why I would like to work there and what I would like to pursue there i hope they hire me.
