I dont think thats good what they doing with the student because there school are not letting then choose there career or what kind of career they want to follow i think is a bad thing what they doing because they not letting the student study what he wants they are choosing what the student can and the career that he is going to follow , i say thatthe student have to say what he wants to be ansd what the they want to study.

From the point the im seeing the situation i dont think in those societies are giving, them a good reason for them to simmit a career,to the student because they are choosing the career for the students and they not letting them to follow a career, that they like because in school they are selecting the classes for the students ,that they are going to follow for only one specific career, and for the age ,that they have i dont think thats a good idea to summit a career because ,you have time to choose what king of career you want to follow and by taking classes for a career that you want and having the time ,and then you think your ready you can summit a career , because what they doing in the school is choosing what the student is going to be went he grows up.

They not letting the student to select there classes that are going to help then in the future for a career , in the school that they going they are selecting the classes ,for the students they not helping them , what they doing is ,that they are giving classes for only one career , and i dont think that they should summit acareer because, they not choosing a career that they want tey are choosing a career, that they giving to them with the classes that they making them have, so student dont have the much career to folow they taking whatever they giving to them.

in conclusion im not agree with what they doing with the student and they still not on the age to summit careers , went they get to the point at school is went you star looking for a career and what you like and what is making you follow the career and i would say ,that if u still in school it dont matter but the school they cant choose what you going to be you have to chose what you going to do and what you like the most and follow your dreams not what others say the you can do do or what you can be you have decide what you going to do the school is to teach you not to chose who you going to be.
