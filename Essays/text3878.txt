Imagine walking into a classroom full of children just glaring at you, ans you teaching them a lesson that they have never heard of. A lesson i would teach to elementary students is about being active in life and why its's important to be active in life and it's,doing sports or or a physical activity, eating healthy, and going to the gym.

Doing a sport is very important, because you are getting the excercise you need and loosing weight. It is very important sports if your a child, because children are young and energetic, so it is good for them to run around. Kids don't have to do sports, they can just go ride a bike around the neighborhood, go for a daily jog, and go ride a skateboard. This could be there daily exercise or weekly excersie.

Eating healthy is very important, because you won't have a high chance of getting diabetes or heart diesease. Kids should eat there vegtables too, because it won't make you gain alot of weight. In my opinion I think vegtables are better than fruits. Children need to stay away from sugar, salt, and greasy food, because if you consume those types of foods it causes high blood presure, which gives you headaches. This could benefit for the rest of their lives.

KIds should go to the gym once in a while, because they can go on a tredmill for 10 minutes. Kids should lift dumbells also, becuase it gets them stronger, and they could lift them at any size. Box jumps are perfect for leg strength, and it helps you with your athlecticism and vertical. The gym is perfect for a exercise routine.

I would teach elementary students about sports and why they need to do it, because it could benefit your life, and going to the gym is an even greater way to stay in shape.
