do you enjoy peolple that is contantly traying to meke you momethimg else?

Some people believe that is good to meke people change because they might like the person but not the person's personality. I'm not agree, becase if someone loves you they are not going to try to make you change, they knew how you were and even thought knowing your deffects they decide to be with you, and to love you how ever you are, if they try to change you means thet tey do not leve you the way they say, so is better to get away from them.

If someone loves you they are not going to try to make you change, dont let anybody to make you change, because if they really loves you they need to learn to loves you, and your deffects matter what.

They knew how you were and even thoght knowing your deffects they decide to be with you, and to love you no matter what, just be yourself do not let anybody play with your mind, because all people are going to try to make you change and they are going to even start say bad things about you but you know who you really are.

f someone ever try to make you change means that they do not really loves you the way they say, so is better to get away from them becase it can be that they can hurt yourself.

However you can change if you want just remind if you change is a big step and it's because you want to change not because people is asking you to change bvecause if they love they are not going to make you change, they are going to treat you good.
