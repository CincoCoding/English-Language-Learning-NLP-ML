Have ever thought a problem can take you to do your best. knowing that you made a mistake or have a problem come to you can eather ruin your plans or take you to do the best. Duke Ellington said " A problem is a chance for you to do your best". A problem can present in any ocattion but is inportant for you to not give up to keep trying and to make that problem a new chance were you can try something new.

Being able to show your solving a skill can also help you in any ocattion. If you are able to show that you can solve anything and take risk to solve tha problem that can be an inportant step for you to take and try to flip that problem to something good . Show your skill show that you can keep trying and try your best to solve that problem wich can take a long time to do but by showing things can also help you in your future.

studys show that solving a problem can increase your brain knowledge imagene if in stead of solving a problem you can flip it into a good thing, and also help in the future. a problem can come from diffirent situation and from different topics which can help increase your knowlegde in that certain topic what happens if you try something new and it fails that can also can make you or can break you. it can break you in the form that you stop tryingand give up or it cna make you if you dont let that problem take control of you and you take your time to solve it or turn it into chance.

do your best to solve that problem or take that chance or turn it into a lelarning process that you know you try ur best and you know you took your time to solve that problem and you can have that expirience in your mind and you know you learn a lot from thatt chance that was once a problem but knowing is a learning expirience. All that you learn can help you in the future. and I agree with what duke ellington said a problem can be a chnce of learning.

making a mistake or having a problem fail can teach you a lot of thing were you can learn from your failing expirience it can sometimes ruin your expirience but at the end of the day you learn from that mistake. That problem can present in any ocattion or time. having the powers to turn that problem into a chance of learning.
