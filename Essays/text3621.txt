Enviroment of Impressions

Two million years ago a person named Jesus arrive to this planet to dwell for a several amount of years, an history we all have been told about witch it takes us to it's death, he spoke to us saying he was our Father. However, he was killed becasue of whom he show up to be, and it's here where we see that it does not matter what impression ypu show up with, people don't mind about it, we all live in a world thst only care for our own good, our onw benefits.

I don't agree in frist impressions are impossible to change, I've meet people that I use to hate now they are part of my life their my family. Independence day, you have an job interview, the first thing they get about us it's first impression no matter what we do and pretent to be someone that we obviuosly aren't they only care about your eargerness, charisma, garment, manners, etc. The popular one meeting new people at school at the beginning we can hate everyone but untli we don't meet that person we won't change our perspective about it personality. In fact, most of us guide by first impressions, and thats the same towards us.

Primaly get can easily get impressed by someone or completely disinterested. we are humans it's imossble to represent our reality we are just like social media when we are with our frineds or at a public place, we fake we act we pretent and thats a common thing we aren't realistic with us and thats where we are given first impression. In conclusion, we are who we choose to be and who we deserve to be, we are in the place that we a re supposed to becasue thats what we deserve, whatever we give it;s what we are going to recieve, and we shouldn't be worried about what we're going to get, what matters it's what we give and judging people woon't tkaes us to the highest place.
