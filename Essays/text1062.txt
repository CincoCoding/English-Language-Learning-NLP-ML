I think that people make their own decisions is technique good. I agree with that for 2 reasons. people have to improve their lifes without help and guidance. People know which is the best decision by themself.

First reason, people have to improve in their lifes without help or guidance. The people have to be indepentdient, also the people have to follow their directions.

Additionally, people know which is the best decision by themself. The people have the responsability to improve their lifes or not, and the people will assume their own responsability if their decisions are bad.

Some people would argue that people don't have knokledge to have a good decision,and they do not have a guidance to follow; however, the people do not have all the time good decisions sometimes the pople choose bad decisions, and the people do not has to have a guidance to follow.

It's clear that people can make their own decisions. I strongly believe that people have the best decisions by themself, and people have to improve in their lifes without help or guidance.
