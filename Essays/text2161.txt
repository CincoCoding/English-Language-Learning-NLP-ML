If I would pick a enjoyable activity it would be art. I

would picked art because you can do anything you want with it. The reason I

picked art was because a long time ago I would be sad or mad. So I went to the consular and she told me

I can use art. And how will

I use it? I would color what i felt and i would take my anger out its like telling someone what you feel except your drawing it.

My secound reason is its not always about drawing you can also the other things with it. You can gather resources and you can build things with that. For example if you had feather and bottles or cans you build a bird out of it. And even just painting something like a wall with difrernt kinds of color thats art.

Also it can be soothing because when you have a lot of tress you can paint. Because whe you paint and your trying to paint the beach it relaxing. For meits relaxing because whe you start to paint the brush won't be hard like a pencil it will just go by so soft you won't have to worry about messing up.

It's also great becauseyou get to learn about artist. Because it will kinda help you. Because it can tell you about how they draw or paint they can have a special way doing it. Like I read artist that used dots to paint and draw I thought that was enterested so i tryed it was kinda of hard. But I enjoyed trying it. This is why i like art becuase you can use it for anything. what is your favourte thing to do?
