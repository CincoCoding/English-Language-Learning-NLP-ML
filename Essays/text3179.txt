I think to working in group will be more beneficial for me, Some reason the

I prefer to work in a group is becouse will can share ideas and opinions that way will be get better grade, Another examples will be, every one in the group will found diferent information and that way we can pick the better information before to proceeding to writng and finich the work.

And another hand my central opinion to work in group will give you the best beneficial because if one of the student get sick the other student can continued to work, that way we can not stop working. And alway work together will supported the idea with the specific information,

Another importan examples is if you working in group you can asked to you group for help, you can shere the work, either one in the group can provide the better ideas and following information in order,

that way all together we can planned the work before writing.

Athoner reason for work in group in my personal opinion is feel more beneficial because you not work alone, that way is less stresfull for each student because every one share the work.

And some time for one reason one of the student has a emergency and the position the best option is work in group because will be more beneficial for each student and the way all the rest of the group can countinued wokt.

and still whole group will be get same grade, however they work together in the group.

In conclusion working with a group is the best, in my personal opinion, I prefer to work in group because the way I improve my work,

working in group is the better way to work because we has many benefits like share ideas, imformation, etc,

and the end I hope you prefer aech student has to keeping work in group.
