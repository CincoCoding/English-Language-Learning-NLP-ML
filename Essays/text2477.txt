I think What thomas jefferson wrote is a pretty good idea. But i also believe that some other people think different , some are agree and others are desagree .People always will give threir own opinions about what the other people do .

There are reason why i think what tomas jefferson wrote is a pretty good idea . For example , if we work hard every day and we always doing something that much may be done . Also the person who wrote the testamnet was someone with classic and that make help to inspire some poeple to never give up . But some other people accomplish about doing something everyday . althought other people are thinkig that inactivity serve a purpose , other are always doing something to be done as soon as they can .Because inactivity will bring you nothing wonderful to your life . In conclusion , i think we all need to think the same way as thomas jefferson to be success in our life's , withouth complaining and always doing something .
