A good attitude is one of the most important things in life, because when you talking or do something with the best attitude you can see how everything is going great, and people feels good and comfortable with you. In the same time, it can open a lot of doors for you, and it can be a good opportunity for be a successful.

On the other hand, people believe that have a good attitude all the time is not a good idea, because some people will make use you, but most of the people who think like that don't have a success life; most of that people in the future feel depressing, feels like they don't do nothing with you life, they are not sucessful, and is something that every person needs thing about, you need prove that you can do it, that you can be a professional, and that you are more than people thing of you, because you need show people that is nothing imposible in life, that all your goals and dreams can makes real.

For example, a person work in a restaurant and you have a good attitude with the customers, you make them feel like in home, not waiting too long for their drinks and food, you will show them that you really happy for have them in there; in the other side, a person who works in the restaurant, don't smile to the customer, make they feel uncomfortable, and don't care about their drinks and food they don't going back to the restaurant or don't choice you for be their waitress, because you don't have a good attitude with your customers.

Also, make yourself a successful person, a person who the people want to talk, a person who a company want to you for work there, a person who do all ther goals and dreams, and a person who love himself, because you got love yourself, respect yourself, and try your best every single day, that is really impotant in your life. The attitude make you go for the best or wrong way, the best give you the best opportunity for a successful person; however, the bad give you the the work in where you do feel good, and where the best part of your day is when you go to the bathroom and use you phone for a couple minutes, when you got to life for check to check, that is the life of people who think the attitude is no the key of success, everyone don't reserve that, they reserve be happy, and have a good life with the people they love.

Also, in home, their parents need show and teach their kids that the attitude is the key of life, that they need have a good attitude if they want to be a good person in the future, that they want to be a professional, and be better person everyday, they will think on that, they will ask themselves why their parents try teach them that the attitude is important, and they will tray to have a good attitude for be a successul person.
