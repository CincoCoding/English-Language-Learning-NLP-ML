I disagree whit this statement,because positive attitude is not the solution for all your problems in life there are many problem that you can beat.

when you came to this country and you are alone and dont have help from other people you just cant be positive you dont understand the language and if you are illegal you dont have the many benefit like if you are born here in the united stated you have to hide from the police sometime you can not find a good job because your situation.

2. when you lost someone important in your family and you cant go to se then because you were in other country etc. you can not be positive for this reason i said what i positive attitude is not good of all.

3. if you are from other country some people discriminate you may be they think is easy to be here they dont think about the danger than you have to pass to be here they discriminate you by your skin color and becouse they think you came to this country just to make money and then came back to your country but sometimes you came to suscive and make a knew lefe but many people dont understand that and they trate you so bad and who can have a positive attitude by this reason.

4. yeah! is right there are many thinks to be positive, like your family,frirnds,girfriend have a good jod, graduate from high school is other reason to ve happy and positive but sometime you just can be positive.

some time when you feel bad and you have a bad economic situation youcant caund whit your friendsbecouse they tell you that tney can help you becouse they dont have the resources but some of then are lyan and if you know it you fell like their are playing whit you and that is not a reason to be positive.

so my point is that you can be all the positive you can but sometime bad thinks happens like youare immigrant and you can se your family and that make you be negative.
