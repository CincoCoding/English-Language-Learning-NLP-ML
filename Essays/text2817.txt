Just think being in a curfew on adoction, just becauses we are on trouble,think about it, sometimes we teenagers we are who has more troubles because of our friends dependen what kind of friends tha we have they may be good friends also bad friends, but think there are people who wants tha all teenager become a good person,they are people who wants you to become a professional. The city is debating the adoction,because they also wants that the teenagers had less troubles, so they can have a family that the can help to advice what is good and bad.

The council it may help the teenagers to be more safely, and being out of many bad things, the council the only thing the it wants to do is find a family, and being more happy, and the family can help the anyone being out of troubles. I think the being adocted by the age of a teenagers it can be really hard ,for they and the mew parents, i think the because we all teenager we already know many things bad or we know things good, but also having new parents they may wants us do new things, that maybe that are gonna help us in the future,

but we don"t know.

Youngers teenagers the only things the we need are parents who are there talking with us,

I thing the it will be fine for many teenagers being adocted bye a family because he can knew new life, out of many troubles, and also it wiil be fine being out of bad band.
