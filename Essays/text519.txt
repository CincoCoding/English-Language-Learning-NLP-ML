An Old Proverb Says Honesty Is The Best Policy

I agree about being honest at all times. Because thats how I was taught and even though I get in trouble, when Im honest it's better than lying. Because lying can get you in to worst trouble. If your always honest people can always trust you and who doesn't want to be trusted? My grandma always told me that when you do something bad or lie karma is going to bite you hard. But, sometimes your going to have to lie for an important reason like hurting someones feelings, I think its a horrible feeling to hurt someones feelings am I right?

However when your honest people will always respect you, like you, and honer you. For an example this has happened to me if your at school and your at lunch and everyone is supposed to be quiet and you and your friend start talking, a teacher calls both of you over and she said,"were you guys talking" my friend said no and I said yes I was talking , and the teacher said, "thank you for being honest you can go back and finish your lunch" but, my friend got in trouble. See thats why its always good to be honest people will respect you more.
