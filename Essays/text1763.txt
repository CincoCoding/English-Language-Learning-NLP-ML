Good Morning,

I just want to start this letter by telling you a little bit more about my interest towards your company . As a matter of fact, the day I heard about the oportunities our school were giving to some students to be able to visit some companies. I absolutely want it participate, Because I want to develope more practice and skills about the job I would want to have when I get out of Collage .

Farther more, I'm very interest to work for a Microsoft company that has being my dreams sinse the day I started using computers and I would want it create something that can help others and create new technology for future Generations. However in my school theres not a lot of programs or clases about computer management or software programing, that could help me and other students to improve our nolage about computer Software. I would want to learn more and get more experience about crearting and fixing computers.

For sure woking at a Microsoft company is what I want to do for a living. Also allowing me to come and visit one of the companies would help me undertand what I'm going to be facing in the future when I start working for a big company

For example, what is exactly the job I'm going to be doing or what job I be able do enjoy doing , or what is going to take to get there etc.

If you allow me this oportunity I can show you my skills and you can see and judge me by my job or what I can do. I belive I can be caplabe to do very creative work and come up with ideas in a matter of seconds to improve new producs. And this oportunity can help me figure out what other type of work i can be able to do.

I appreciate the oppotunities your companies are giving to our school and other schools in general, but now I would want to know if you could give me chace and the privilege to come to one of your companies and learn more about Microsoft Programing and computers. I believe I can apport a lot to this company.
