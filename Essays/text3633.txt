Do you think that positive attitude would make you successful?

For my point of view, I think that is good to be positive, becaus if you are positive you have more chance to be successful in life, most of the times you can or can not regreat good things. Is good to be positive on the bad times, that way you do not feel worse. If you have a positive attitud, some people that have negative attitude is going to try to make you change, do not let that happend. be positive can make you a better person.

If you are going through bad times is always good to be and think positive, if you are a negative person you are going to see only the bad things of the good things, you can lose friends or you're family members, if you are a negative person, no body is going to like to be next to you.

negative people is going to try to make you change; some people can be selfish and if you always think positive and most of the times you regreat positive things, they are going to want to have what you have even though that you work hard for if.

However some pople can think positive things but they can act negstive, it does not means that that good or not to think one thing and act with another thing, but if you want positive thigs happend to you most of the times, do positive things too. Be positive can help you to be successful but remember "actions talks more than 1,000 words."
