In the future first thing i would really like to do is graduate from high school with good grades and also making it to a great collage. I would really like to go to collage to study about how to be a lawyer but before i can make it to collage, it's very important for me to make sure i'm doing good in school and also making sure my grades are good, i am hoping to graduate high school with being top of my classes. I want to show people that with trying your hardest, you can sussed in life. I would be the first in my family to make it to collage. I want to make my parents proud. something i also enjoy doing is helping people out. Me being a lawyer means i can help people out with problems might they have with the state law.

2. Before my dream can come true, i have to work hard. I have to make sure I am doing all my school work, making sure i get to school on time. also something thats very important is keeping your life profile clean. staying out of trouble is very important, something collages well look at is grades and your background life. a collage wouldn't want someone who has bad grades, someone who is always getting into trouble or someone who just doesn't care bout anything. They look for people who are trying their hardest to be someone in life. going to collage means you want to try hardest so you can be someone in life. collages teach you everything on what you want to be. they help you make your dreams come true.

3. Something i'm also looking forward is to learn on how people do their job. i want to learn how they speak up for the person who they are helping out, how do they know what to say, is it scary? i have so much questions t ask. my goal is to be someone who can help people out, who everyone comes for when they need help. i would like to make people happy but right now my goals are to make sure i finish school. i have to work hard to keep my grades good and also make sure i stay out of trouble.
