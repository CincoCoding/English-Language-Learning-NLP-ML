Its a fact that possitive actitude is the key of succses. In every single thinsg that you made, or every single act that you take, even a small ane like blink if you are not confident in what you are doing, on that i will make it fealling, you will be failing.

That does not mean that fealing is a bad thing because fealing is a important aspec of successes. Not only because you will learn from the mistakes that led you to the failing box. But also you will come back knowing against what you are figthig with, next time you will be back with a diferent set of mind, with a diferent plan, even with a diferent actittude, and all that because one thing wich all the people says is bad.''Fail''.

but lets be honest, why would somebody fail if you have the chace to be successfull ?, because if you are not going to win and get what you want and are looking for, do not even struggle, stay at home laying donw and watching some series. There is a real hungry world with real hungry people out there and if you are just giving the 75 percent it of your capacity it would be just not enougth.

Thats were positive actittude comes up, if you know your value and you are wheling to give the one hundred percent you dont have to worry.

If you are confident and positive you will go for what you are looking fof do not matter who is agaist you, do not matter what the people would say and specially it do not matter the cost of it. That is the key of success.
