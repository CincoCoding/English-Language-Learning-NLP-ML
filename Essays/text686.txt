Going to parks can be exiting for people because they get to have fun by playing tag, hide and seek, or maybe look at insects. I like going to parks because i get to ride my BMX bike around with my friends. some adults go to parks to exercise, others like kids get to play and have fun by swinging or playing on the slides.

Some kids go outside in front of their house and play other games like hopscotch, jump rope, or like other people they can do other activities outside and ride bikes around or go to a skate park. there are endless amounts of activities for people to do outside, playing on the swings at the park can be fun because when i go there i like to see who can go the highest and sometimes i just do it for fun when im bored

People that like to find and inspect bugs can go at the park, the park has lots of bugs including butterflies, ladybugs, caterpillar, and fireflies. some people find bugs interesting for some reason. theres also a park called a dog park. but you would normally see kids having fun, Other people at the park like to play tag, tag is a very fun game and i think that kids would have fun playing it, hide and seek is also an option. theres no point of going to the park if you can't have any fun. My favorite thing to do at the park is play on the swings, when i get bored i start to ride my BMX bike around my neighborhood. Spending time outdoors is good for you. The park has a lot of things you can explore there,but playing is my favorite.

There can also be some animals at the park like birds and ducks, there is also a place called a dog park where dogs go to play and have fun, dogs need fun too! at the dog park you can teach your dog tricks there or just let him/her have fun, maybe even let them meet new dogs! but in my opinion a normal playground is better. Taking your dog for a walk is an activity you can do outside but you can do anything outside or in a park as long as you have FUN.
