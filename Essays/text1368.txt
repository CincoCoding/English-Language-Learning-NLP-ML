Thomas Jefferson was a president, and he wrote this to help people to do their work always.

It is really good when we are doing our work and it will be done when we doing it always and we will learn it to do it will be easy for ourself.

Somtime it will be boring to do our work always but it is good that we can learn it really good if we do it always.

I am doing my work and my job and my sport always because it will help me to remember it and also doing always is good that can learn us till we can teach it for example: when we are reading a book always it will help us to learn a lot about everything the people that they are not doing good and always there work and there job they are lazy people and they will not learn anything when they do not doing it always.

If we think about it we can see the diffrent between the people that they doing always are better than the people that they do not doing it always so like: doing homwork always, sleeping on time always, going to sport always, going to job always and etc.

We will help the people and tell them to there there work always we should help them.

In the first when the school start i was not good and i was not doing my homworks and studing always until my friends help me and told me to do my work always and i am glad that i learn this to do my work always and i want everyone to do there work always never forget it. And also when we are always eating good food it will keep us healthy and we do not need go to the doctor always.

keep doing it always.
