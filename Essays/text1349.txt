This program help both students to learn about what are the responsability of the olders students and the youngers student to see what they going to do when they becomes a older and the olders student can learn from de younger student.

The olders student can teach about mistake because every one have different mistake they can teach younger student to do right things and can help each others

The yourger student can also learn about theres mistakes they make the program to thye olders students can go to visit the yourger student to help them, to them they can help the youngers student to learn from theres mistakes the olders student can teach the younger student about the life to do the right things

The youngers student needs the olders student like the olders student need a adult to they can say dont do this is the same the younger student need the olders student they can help each others if the youngers studetn have a promble or a question they can ask the olders student to do right this some student of the youngers schools they dont know english the olders student can help them some times the olders student needs the youngerts students to do somenthing like if the olders sstudent dont know somenthing they can ask the younger students if someone has problems with something they can help each others they can do many dinfferent things together there are many types about programs that can help younger students and olders student sometimes if is a fight with youngers students the olders student can stop them and say to them to do the right thins because in this life everyone has mistakes nobody is perefect they can help each others to the rights things and the different about this two kinds of student is the olders student have more responsability and the younger student have responsabily but the dont have much like the olders students or the olders students dont have the mu\ch responsability from the adult one time my dad tell me that when he was youngers he need help with somenting but he dont want to tell a older person he tell me if one time i need help with something i can ask a older one to help me to do tghe right this and to learn from ours mistakes we can help each others olders students are important because they can help the younger student to know about this life the younger students start to learn more about this life the olders student know what is right and what not right they can help each others to practice the armony of this two kinds of students the youngers student can learn much about thir sames mistakes know a big problem has the olders student dont want to help the youngers students the diferent betweet is the olders student know the right things and the bads things so thas why the can help each others

Also in betwen thius two kinds of student are a different types somentimes the olders studeents dont want to help the youngers students and the younger student dont want to listeng from the olders student so theirs is a problem somentimes the olders student want to teach somenthing important to the younger student ,and the younger student dont want to listeng the olders student so we have a different there like now the oplders student dont want to listeng the aldult or theirs teachers so whent someone says dont do this more you do it and when the consecuense cames we dont want that so my we need the olders student to teach as to know what is good or bad like the olders student need a adult to they cant tell them dont do this or do this but they cant hit them they can only tell them don't do this this is bad for you or what is good for you they need thir helps esch others they can proctect each others
