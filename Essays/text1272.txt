When you are a kid your parents tell you what your character is have to be they teaching you how you have to be they intent to help you to be a better person, for example they tell you what is wrong and what not, what you can do and what you can't do.

But when you are a big person you can choose whoever your character is gonna be, for example you choose what is wrong and what is good for you because you are big now and you can do your own decision. You're able to thing and get the responsibilities to choose your own character, and you are agree if you make a mistake your gonna take the consequences, because your choose to be like that.

So is not beyond our control because you thing how you wanna be for your life for the things you are learned before in the past and that is the things the changing you. is nothing out of control because you can choose your character, Examples if theres a man who needs help you can choose be a good person and help him or just let him there and thats make you a a bad person and when you needs help nobody is gonna help you.

The character is important in a person because the character make you who you are thats why you have the power to choose what your character is gonna be you cna choose how you wanna be a good person or bad person and thats the person you wanna be.

And you character is what make you the person you are and the people is ginna say that your are a good person or not depend the what your character choose and thats it the character it was make a person.

So thats what i said, i said we choose our own character traits.
