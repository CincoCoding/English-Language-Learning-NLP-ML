I disagree with schools having a program with older and youngest students

Many younger students does not know anything about program

Many older students are smartest then the youngest students

Many youngest students are not smarter than the older students

1. One day when i was on elementary school i was in 4th grade and my teacher put me on a program with older people and the older people were smarter than me and i din't knew anything and the older people knew everything i was the only one who dint knew any thing.

2. The other day i was on middle school and i was on a program and i was on 8th grade and i was in a program with youngest students the youngest students werent smartest than the older student and there was a kid who dint knew anything on the program.

3. The last thing when i was i high school i was in 10th grade and i went to a program with young students and i was smarter then younger students and and my teacher was prud of the older students.
