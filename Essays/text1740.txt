An enjoyable educational activity could be playing an intrument,an intrument could teach someone to practice everyday,by practicing could lead you to learning new techniques to play that type of instument. Being enspired by someone to do that instrumet or what ever you want to do you need somone to motivate you for example, their was this one time where my brother motivated me to play the chello and I did and it felt good,because I practiced everydaycand I loved doing it. Thats why practicing is important.

Having fun while playing in band or orchestra your able to travel to diffrent states to learn how difrrent groups play,

learn diffrent songs, and learn the sites of that certain city. Thats why I joined orchestra when I was about 9-10years old I learned about 20 new songs that 1 school year and I loved doing it. It was fun to watch, and hear them while playig it was probably the best year i had in 3rd grade.

The people in your group are like your family you guys are going to travel together and perform together. And even making freinds to the new kids who join later in the year so dont worry about being left out while traveling to that certain state your always going have someone to talk to be around. YouCAn also make friends in the new state you travelled to thats why playing an intrument is so enjoyable.
