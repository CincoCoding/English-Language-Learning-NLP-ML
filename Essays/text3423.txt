i think working 10 hours a day is way better then working 8 hours a day you can save alot of energy and electrricity and your time in a day. in 4 days working 10 hours a days is like 40 hours a week. still if you want to do overtime you can still do overtime on friday and saturdays.

working 10 am to 10 pm is better then working 8am to 4 pm. i think my school should change the school hours and save some time. they should extrend the school hours to 2 hours so that the kids can get enough sleep when they go home and they can do there work at the jobs too. if my school extends the school hours to 2 more hours then kids can get off for 3 days from school. that's how schools can save alot of energy water etc. teachers can get 3 days a week off too if my school extedns 2 more hours and make it to 10 hours. there should be just 4 days school in a week. some people have hard time to wake up early in morning so they can do there homework. when students get enough sleep they can focus more in there studies and they get more time during weekends too do there homewoks. that's how students can achieve there goals in high school when they get enough sleep they can stay more fresh and active during school hours. in high schools most of the students have hard time during the whole school year just because they do not get enough time to do there homeworks during the weekends most of the students work 32 to 38 hours a day so they do not get enough time to do there homeworks on saturday and sundays.
