I agree that "to be yourself in a world that is constanly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment". A lot of people now a days are trying to be somoone else like soccer players,rappers,basketball players, and not to choose they self and that not going to make them reach for they goal.

From my experience in life is that I want to be ronaldo when I was 15,16,year old and that wasn't good because it change my mind set not to be myself and to be someone else. But I learned a lesson is to be my self all the time to know who I'm today and reach for my own goals. People should be proud to be they self because being yourself make you ,stronger,helpful,and smarter. And my advice is to be yorself and learn from your mistakes.

Don't look at famous peopel and try to be them just be yourself and do your on thing to be successful in your life.
