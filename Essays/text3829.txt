Have you failed at some so much at one point you get so good at whatever you were failing at???well if you have this promt is for you. yes i bevelie that failure plays a important role in the pursuit of success, there was this one time when this kid wasnt so good a catching a football it kept slipping out his hands and after awhile he was able to grip the football at the right time, if you dont practices stuff you bad at you're never gonna get good at it ,with that said that means your going to fail alot over and over again. failure is also life your going to fail in life but its youe chose to get back up and try again untill perfection ,if you never fail you with never success so if you fail dont let it get you down keep trying and soon enogh you be,althoght you might also think that thats not true becuse some people are really talented but keep in mind that noone is good at some thing first try NEVER, i want you to try some you're not good at and keep practicing for about a month and see your progress ,i would like for everyone to try this and see that fail does run a big roll in success.
