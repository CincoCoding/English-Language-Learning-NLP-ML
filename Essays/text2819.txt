I my opinion the Minister Winston Churchill its right, because to learn something you need to see it not just of the success fool side. You need to learn of the mistakes too.

The problem of someone how never has experimented the failure, is that when this happen its going to be more pain fool that someone how has that experience.

Imagine a pro football player and he never in hes life lost, and for the first time in his career lose: he is going to suffer more and maybe get in depression because he never experiment the feeling of lose. But the football player how has hes loses and didnt stop and keep fighting if he lose now he know what is the feeling, he is more prepared.

You need to feel what is loss, its going to make you a more prepared person, who knows what you want and how to do it, but you cant surrender you need to all ways keep going; is your life, your goals, your decisions and no one cant stop you.
