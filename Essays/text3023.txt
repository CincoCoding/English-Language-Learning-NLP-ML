Been said thet a positive attitude is thr key to success in life.

Because, thet attitude is the definition for the person.

My central idea is whet the attitude definition of the person.

A men position or feeling with regard to the fact or state. The position is they something in the une relation to somethinng else. A negative or hostile state of mind, a cocki or arrogant manner.

My idea is an offensivery pesonal remark and they attitude tietine so mach what, thry collection of emocional and beavioral traits that charecteriste a person, distribution of personal and social traits a well knonk person.

Think is what they attitude is very importan of they people.

Definition on Spanish:La actitud define a las personas si nuestra acitus es mala las personan se alejan de uno. Pero si somos personas con buenan acitud todo va a salir bien.

In my person my attitude is very dificul. For my attitude i lost many person in my life. Therebe sideways our evil attitude's.
