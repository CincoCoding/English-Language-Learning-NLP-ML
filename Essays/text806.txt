I disagree beacuase anyone can change there impression anytime. If you don't like someone and your talking to them your impression won't be the same, as your impression to your family.

some people disagree because anyone can change there impression anytime. Like when have you seen someone impression the same when they gift them a toy then when they give them a book. Some people will agree that impressions dont change but you can fake your impression anytime.

other people will agree because some people can show the same impression anytime. there wrong because no one cant have the same impression everyday. Some people fake a smile every day and when they get home there down and crying a lot. other people that agree that people can have the same impressionthey gotta look at it from another point of view.
