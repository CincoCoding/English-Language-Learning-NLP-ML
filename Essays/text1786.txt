do you agree or disagree with the statement?

in my personal opinion i do agree that first impressions are almost impossible to change. its impossible to change because thats the very first time you meet someone new in your life. first impressions are very important. there is no way you can change first impressions its not like we can go back in time to switch our answer. making a bad first impression can go very wrong but thats that its done and you cant go back. for example like making a first impression at a job interview like obviously making a good impression is very important if you want a job.

i can also understand why some may say "almost impossible" because technechly you kinda can. for example if both of you say "can we start over" or something like that. your always going to have that impression from the first time you guys ever meet. so really it goes both ways how someone may take it. i personal dont agree with that because it dosent sound right or feel right. some may move on and ectually forget. while others may not and mentally remmber.

inconclusion it is all based on the reader and how they take it. like i have mention i personal dont think you can change your first impression. we cant go in time and change the past. it donesnt sound reasonablie theres no real reason. some may agree with what i say some may not. then again i can kinda see how someone may want or how to change there first impression.
