i would take the offer of finish high school early and stay after school because they giving a chance to finish early so you might just take it you get to go to college early and probably get a full time job get you're own money and not worry about not having money no more.

It is a good idea because some people would like to finish early then late some of them would rether get a job then come to school but you need education to get a good job and be succsesfull in life and a better job gets you good money for the people that like to spent money on clothes and stuffs like that

A lot of kids dropping out ofschool why because like i said they rather get a job then go school but you need school to get a good job but they giving you the oportunity to graduate early but some kids just guve up on school and drop out of school but i would take the oportunity to finish school early so i can be succesfull in life and have a better life and not worry about not having money.

But some students wouldnt like to come during summer or after school so they would have to ask all the studets so they can agree to see what they prefer to do like just take the classes the you really need for graduation insted oftaking classes that you dont need for graduation so they wouldnt have to stay after school or come during summer
