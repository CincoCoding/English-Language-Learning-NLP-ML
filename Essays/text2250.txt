when people ask for advice, sometimes seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by seeing if most peoples opinions are the same and its a good advice some opinions maybe better then others , you can also recave better advice from differnt people like your best friend can give you an advice that will help you lot but the other person that you dont really talk to that person doesnt really know how to help you like your best friend does , each opinion can help you with something different like some one may give you advice about a sport you may not need it right now but you could use it later in life so each opinion can help you later in life it may not help you never know , for example if you need advice on how to do better in school or how to get your grades up you would ask a teacher or your friends but someone else can give you bad advice or it doesnt helpe youor on how not to do well in school so its better to ask multiple peolpe then just one because you have a higher chance of getting good advice frome differnt people and you have more to opinions then just asking one persone beacse he may not have th best advice but he will try to help but you have a lower chand you can see wich helpe more and wich dont really dont helpe you would be getting good advice that will sadisfide you, so in my opinion asking multiple people for advice is better is a better chose then just asking one persone.
