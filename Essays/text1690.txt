I think that a act of kindnees is great for people to see that there are people that are nice and can do nice things. maybe people dont see that nice people get treated better vs. people that don't do nice thing don't get treaed the same way . that why people that dont do act of kindness need to starr now so they know what it feels like to be good or just saying somethnig nice is good to but when you put time to it that is better to. people need to help other and respet each other everone has a good side to them even if they say they don't . you can see that when they where kid they where nice and kind but they grow up and they think that they can do bad thing and do not help people that need it or saying soming nice to them, but ever one has a diffrent ways of being them self and finding ways to not be nice or kind to others that are nice to them adn they don't want to do the sma e that want to be the mean one thae one that does not care what other think or do and try to hide from the fear that they can get in troble for doing this that are not to be seen or done at school , at home or even outside where you can get in to big troble . people need to more act of kindness in school when i was in 5th and 6th with the same teacher all we did was do act of kindness because she wanted us to see that just a note to someone you care or love about can make you and the person feel better than they alredy where.
