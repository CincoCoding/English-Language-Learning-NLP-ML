Today I'm going to share my thoughts about Author Ralph Waldo Emerzon wrote to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest acomplishment.

I would say yes is the greatest acomplishment because if you trying to be someone in the world but you don't have no body to be with you is wanna be more difficult but if you try your best you can make it but if you have like people with you that is trying to help you is wanna be more easy, so I think to be your self in world that is constantly tying to make you something else it's one of the greatest acomplishment.

I would say is true because to be yourself around people that is negative is wanna be difficult. So to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you soemthing else is the greatest acomplishment.

for example

If you just been yourself and you making all that you want, a lot of people they not wanna like that so they wanna try to make you fall, so if you been in a world that is constantly trying to make you else is always wanna be the greastest acomplishment.

if you are in a world that people like you only for been yourself it is good becasue you just been yourself you can make anything happen and if you have a world that is constantly trying to make something else is the best acomplishment because everything is wanna be more easy for you sometimes you have to choose decision and i think just been yourself you always can taje the right ones
