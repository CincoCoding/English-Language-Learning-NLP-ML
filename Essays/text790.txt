people should choose achievement for self - esteem. because that may help them to put more work , more skills, and more existent for get some thing . but some people think praising is good for self - confident in order or learn . self -confident is cant not help them , because the might be lazy for learning some stuff .

here are reason why they should be achievement .

achievement for student more hard working than praising student . for example let say you are try to work very hard if the teacher praised to student the student going to give up the work or get so upset . student needs achievement to more work done.

praising is not a bad thing. so this is why people should pick an achievement .

let say you wanna make students to do some project for about how to draw an art . if one of them succeed on their project and other one praising him it will not make sense for them . but if you active them that will be their for history of their school years.

and lastly achieving the student makes them more happier than praising the student . because may the get high points or good grade (A or B) or better than praising the student .i should say self-esteem comes from achievement .

these are the three reason why self-esteem comes form achievement .
