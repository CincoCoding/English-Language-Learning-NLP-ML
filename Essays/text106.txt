Having good aditude is very important in life beacuase thats what u would need to have in many things, childhood and adult hood etc. Why having a good aditude is very important is say for example, if ur trying to apply for a job, its good to have a good aditude at all times is because if ur looking foward to get the job and have good adidute and be pacient, theres a higher chance you will get the job. My second reason on why having good aditude is important is that say that u didnt get the job, always stay cool and not try the flash out on anyone or even put it on anyone because you can always try again and theres always jobs that are hiring and available. There are many benifets of good aditude but few benefits are making friends, having a good life with no hate in your heart, get hired at jobs u apply at and many more. Benifets of having bad aditute can lead u to a place you wont like places like Jail if u talk back and not follow instructions or evan go to jail for not paying ur bills, get a office referal for not following directions and doing bad in school too. I've also witnessed bad aditude and good growing up. As in fifth grade I wasnt the best kid but I made bad decision and talk back at the teachers etc and that lead my mom taking away my ps4 so i cant play on it untill I fix what im doing. Also I remember when i was little, in church that if me and my siblings did good and behaved at church that my mom will buy us one candy each at a gas station of our choice so we followed that and had good aditude through out the whole church sessions continusly through out the times we attended church. Before my mother passed thats one of the many things she've taught me and my siblings to always have good aditude is because u can acomplish anything u worked hard at and respect people around you and a holy place like church. Now you know that having good aditude can effect not just you but people around you and your future.
