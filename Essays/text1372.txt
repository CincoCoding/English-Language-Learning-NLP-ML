" In this world you decide who do want to be either you get along with it or someone teach you" although some people think that our character formed by influences beyond our control nevertheless we choose our character traits people on your environment and also people who you talk to i believe that the one that influence me is that we choose our own characters

First People on your environment influence a lot because in front of them you decide who you want to be and you choose your traits so i think that you choose your traits on the type of environment that you are on on you are living for Example My brother Generic_Name when he was around me he was a different person we talked like brother help each other as brothers when he was around Dad And mom he was another type of person he was not the same with me he was more kinder but when we were on school he another type of person he was mean He didnt care about me and other people he wouldn't treat me he changed his traits to a whole different level That proves that a person can changes their traits depends on the environment that they are growing.

second people who we talked too we eventually we change our way to be to different people the way that we talk to our people are a different person when u talk to your relatives friends coasins brotheres we eventually changed the way to be for example one day A guy named Generic_Name recived a call from his parents saying Generic_Name its time to come home And Generic_Name respectfully said Tes mom i will go home right Away after he finish his call he talked to us saying Dude i need to leabe but like right now!! screming that proves that we change the way that act with different people or the way that we talk with different types of people.

to conclude we choose our character traits because we talk and and people around we choos ehow we act aroubd people people who we talk to are the ones that affect us more because thats the one that we do on daily bases the other one people on your enviroment is the way that u want to be looked by different type of people around your self.
