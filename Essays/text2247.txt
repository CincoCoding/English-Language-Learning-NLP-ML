Conserving energy and resources should not mean that children should go to school for only four day and 2 hours. Children are not going to be able to process what there laurning. Some children cant benefit from this. There are tomay people that need more help then others. People need the benefit of more school day. School is inportent to many people. We need them school day.

Conserving energy is a good thing for people but children need time for school, with not that much time for school we are going to have a lot of people failing or droping out. Children like school because out side of school, they dont have nothing and school is the way out of having nothing but they make the best of it. Them people that dont have notheing make something out thim safes from school like sports. People that play sports need school too. How are they going to play if there grads are bad or they need to stay after school to practs. They need it more because there trying to reach to the NFL and not that much people can do it. Poeple are just trying to make it throw or other people that just dont care.

Two hours, you are not going to laurn nothing, time is most inportant to many people. People will need more then 2 hours. Teachers most inportint need more time to work. Theres not even going to get payed will they need more time. How are they going to pay there bills. People need to under stand that people have inpront thing to pay. People need to thank about other people not just them selfs.

Time people need it,but we need more, we dont need less. Poeple are happy how they are right know. The time is most inportent to people. Conserving energy and reources are very inportent but just to go to school just four day and two hours i dont beleave its that inportent.
