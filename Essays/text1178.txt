Yes, I agree with Churchill's statement, because it is true that failure is one of the ways to get better from that failure.

Also failure is a common thing that happens to people, and it also help us to learn better from the mistakes, then giving up. For example my friend Generic_Name, he had 20 dollars in his pockets and he went to a game store to get the news video game at was only 25 dollars. But there was even a new updated on a game that he already have, and it was 10 dollars. And he won't get paid back until two weeks and the updated won't be availed until next week. so he went bought the updated game, but he didn't knew there was a sale on the new game on the online store that was only 16 dollars. But now he sometimes check to see if there any sales or deals before he goes to the store.

For another example a old man said he bought a new car but realize it was missing some pieces. Then he started to look round the internet to see if any of the parts that he needs are buy able. So far there wasn't a whole all of the items for the car. but he didn't stop giving up that easily. But one day he find all the parts and fix his car.

Also I had a friend who was going to the park, but forgot where is the park is and sometimes forget how to get back. Because he takes along way back home and to the park. Which he should take the short cut like I tell him, but he doesn't care, he like long walks. but one day he designed to take the short path thought the area, and he kinda like it its easier get to places for him. So he told me and he felt sorry that he didn't listen to me first, but I forgave him. And now he even listen to other people too like friends, and family too.
