I recommend to the students take the tradicional four years. If the students take four years of high school they are able to take elective classes. The students will have more time to do their homeworks to concentrate more in classes. Many high schools the tradicional is four years of high school that is a good choice for the students. Students will have more experience having four years of high school. The students will learn more things in one more year of high school.

Concentrate more taking four years of high school.
