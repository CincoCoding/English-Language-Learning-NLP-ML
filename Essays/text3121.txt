No i think students should not have any cell phones at school at all because there could a lot of noises , and maybe it could be distracting to other students . That's why i think students should not have cell phones during the school time .

To begin with student should not have cell phones during the school time because it could make a lot of noises . so if you have a cell phone right and your in class and its in high volume and you receive a call or a text message that's not right because teachers are trying to teach you and all your doing is making noise . That's why i think we should not have cell phones during the school time .

In addition i think we should not have cell phones in school hours because it could be distracting to the students or even the teachers , because last week there was a girl texting during class and the teacher saw her so he had to stop his lesson and take her phone away and rite her a referral . So that's distracting and a waist of time isn't it. That's why i think they should not have cell phones during school hours because its distracting .

Those are the reasons why they should not allow cell phones during the school hours because is distracting and it makes to many noises .
