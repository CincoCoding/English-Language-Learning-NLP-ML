It has been said that the first impression are almost impossible to change. I agree that the first impression is almost impossible to change about this topic because it's logical and very important about the first impression to life, and a have my own experience to share about this topic to share.

when i was7 years old my first impression comes in my mind is to have my own car but its was impossible because i was seven years old and I was a kid but I decide to come in united state but, also its was impossible for me because my parents was poor of money three years later I get the same impression that day its was the most important to my life and the impression it can be easy or hard to achieve but i did it and I come to the united state.

The fist impression is very important but is not easy to change all people was one impression and sometime they think thats impossible but if they work hard they will get it because is important for them.

The first impression that all people have is the most important to life because they can have a different stuff on mind my impression was to come in the united state and i did it because I its was my dream and my impression to have more opportunity to have more impression in mind.

there is not only one impression that i have theres so many things that i want to do maybe make a lot of money or buy my own house but the first impression is not impossible.
