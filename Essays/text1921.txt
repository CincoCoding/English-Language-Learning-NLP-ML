Dear principal i am writhing this letter, to aprove your oppinion about changind the school menu because is something good for the school and for the student, to try something different, and something healthier, some student would like the idea of changing the food menu because they have been eathing the same food over the first day of school, and other would not like the idea of changing the menu because they have already have they favorite food, but most of the student would be happy, to change the food menu to something better, and it is a good idea, because some studend dont eat at the the school lunch, instead they go ouside the school to buy food at the restaurant, and other make they onw food at home to eathed at the schoo, in my oppinion it will be better to try something new to see what it would happend in the futere and how the student would react on the change of the lunch menu, instead of eathing the same food every year of schoo, it cand be a bad thing or a good idea changind the school menu for example it may be worse and student would dont like it or it cant be good and more student would eat the school lunch.
