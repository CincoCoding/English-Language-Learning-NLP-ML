Thomas Jefferson wrote "Determine never to be idle" that is mean like some time we are busy. I agree with this prompt becasause it's something posible and if we always doing something.

In my opinion we acomplish more if we are always doing something because some times we have stuff to do for example going to work after school or study after school. But some time people they don't like to do school work for the reason they think there are not smart. In my position do work it's some i like to do every day because that's how i learn more stuff. IF we have a park time after school that is something good because you are reciving money for your self and maybe you can help your parent with bills.

Some peoples think that if we don't do something in this life we ca have a vetter remposible. That is mean if we don't work or study for a vetter life them we are not going to have nothing for .Exaplem if you are

18 or more you have to look for a jod becase you are respomsible for your self because your parents there are not going to give you anything what you want you have to work and buy your own stuff. This is something posible we can do in us life.

Some may said that to do nothing is better life. they said that becsause they never think about thre future or maybe they don't want to do nothing in the life and that is not going to work. for exaple I have a lot stuff to do for gratuade from hight school i have to pass my esol and have a good great grade if i don't graduate from hight school that choise i have is to work out side. However, if a want the opportituti to do something in the future the best choie is to study effort my self and go to the college to have a better jod.

people Sometimes they're bussy in keys that is something posible in us life becuse we want to become a good person and resposible in the future that's that way we learn it is easy to do something never give up.
