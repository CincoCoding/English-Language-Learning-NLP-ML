Students may say inactivity is the way to go, However other student say keeping yourself occupied will lead you towards achievement. But staying occupied is the way to go if you wanna be successful and achieve things in life. Sitting around and doing nothing wont lead you to anything sucessful in life.

If your at home sitting around having nothing to do will not help you to be successful. If you try to find something productive to do it will help you in the future. To be productive or to do something productive really does'nt have to be school work related it can be anything like having a job, chores or helping around the community.

Lets say you have home work but you dont feel like doing it, because your used to not doing anything and or are lazy to do it. which means you are more likely to procasanate. On the other hand if your used to doing your work the same day its assigned and or turn it in on time you are less likely to procasanate because you are used to staying occupied and doing all your work.

From my own expierence, when i was 14-15 years old i wouldnt do anything at home or at school which caused me to do negative things that didnt lead me to achieve my goals at that moment. Now that im 17 years old i keep myself busy by doing school work or working my part time job, which wont cause a negative effect on me because im preparing myself for my future and life goals.

Overall students think that doing nothing is the way to go, but other students say that keeping themselves occupied leads them to a succeful and positve life.

Now a days i can tell that teenagers that have been getting into legal trouble really dont have anything to do outside of school. While other teenagers actually do outdoor and indoor activtiy to keep themselves out of trouble.
