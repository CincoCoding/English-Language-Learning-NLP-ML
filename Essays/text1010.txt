''Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow''. Try to be better, and learn things that we don't know is the only way to grow. Trying new things to be better on things that we are already good. Having always family's motivation to keep going up, and for our learning proces. Learn from our mistakes, to grow as a person and never say never to anthing is a goog meaning of grow. For these reason i think we have to learn something beyond wath we have already mastered.
