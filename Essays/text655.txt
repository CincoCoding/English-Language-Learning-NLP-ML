I planned my paper before writing it. Because if you planned your paper before writing it is more easy so you can be ready to writte any important information about anything that the teacher tell you to writte about. I can be saomething that can help you to make your grades better because if don't planned your paper can cause you a lot of problems because when is your turn comes to writte. you are not going to be ready so the teacher is going to look at youu and she will be upset with you for example. if i don't planned my paper in time i can get in travel too because i an not doing what the teacher tell me to do so thats why you have to prepared in time before you get in travel because you are the one who is loosen point's not the teacher becuase she is telling you what you have to do. but if you decide not to follow the rules is going to be a problem.

One morething is you planned your paper on time you are doing great because planned your paper before writing it is something good the teacher is gonna be happy in you will get better grades. another example of planned your paper before writing is the information you have to writte is really important you don't ganna miss the information so thats why you have to be prepared in be ready for what is going to come.

I checked my paper to be sure that my message will be clear to my reader, is really important to checked what you writing or what are you going to do because if a writte a paragraph an if didnt write corretly an i handet to my reader an his start reading it his going to tell me what i did wrong so you have make sure checked your paper with a message before you handet to the reader or to you parents etc.
