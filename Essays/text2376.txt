Some may say you should seek for guidance; however i believe that taking your own path is really important and self taught. For example taking your own path is like concurring the world. enjoying what life brings and challenges to succeed Ur journey . you can be taught to be strong , no fear ever given fearless and a strong independent person. life can bring you so many surprises and you will fight and get what you truly deserve.

Taking your own path not seeking for guidance is a really important thing to do and accomplish. Its a wonderful thing its like doing the impossible ; never thought life choices crazy things that will change Ur life for the best . At the end of the road just no u did the impossible life changing,spectacular,amazing choice. Everybody will doubt you hate you tell you that you cannot do it that you wont last; but when you do it just no u achieved the impossible.

Taking your own path is setting you up[ for life things you have never done. being ahead of everyone knowing where the journey will take you. knowing that you have done that many have not is breathe taking. truly knowing where you want to go is all that u need at the end life will take you where will best deserve it . You can get where you hallways wanted to be.

There for i believe that taking Ur own way and doing it alone and succeeding it is the best way to Ur journey.
