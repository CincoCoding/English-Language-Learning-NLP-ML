Taking out the student favorite food shouldn't be taking out cause a lot of kids wont even come to school cause of the lunch and but if there different kinda food it would maybe make kids love lunch more. its a really bad idea coming from the principal. And something kids may not like the food from the beginning cause it may not be cooked right, or it may have the lunch lady hair in it, and lunch ladies should ware hair nets when they cook the food in the morning and after noon.

And this should be for the bananas too if they don't look good you should throw it away and some other food it are past days. well a lot of kids dont care about what they eat only if its good. And Chips or other snacks shoudn't be taking away either mostly poeple like snacks more then food. it would be better just too leave the food alone and let people enjoy it.
