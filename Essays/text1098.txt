the reason i think that we should not have more school time is because some people in school would not be able to keep up with other kids. and most kids get ttired of being in school for six hours imagine being in school for longer then that and even more kids would start going to sleep in school. because they are already tired of all the classes during the day.

with another good reason that i disagree with adding more time in school is because some people have to do things after school like take care of family or go somewhere important and if you added more time then they would not be able to do get this stuff done because they would be stuck in school learning longer then the time they are accually supposed to get out.

i belaive that there should not add more time to school because it would also be a waste of time because teachers would have to do even more stuff done buy more stuff for students and get more work done grade more papers because we would have a longer school time and then the teachers would have to write more speak more and do stuff more then they would if we had only six hours in a day.

with another reason that i dont thing school should not be longer is that it would not only affect the students and the teachers but it would affect everyone because then the whole school board would have to do more work and the school would loose a lot of money because the school board would have to buy more stuff for students and get more things that kids would need to get everything set up good for the students.

with another good reason we should not have longer school cause if we had longer time kids would not be able to handle so much because they would be learning so many thing in one day and then it would confuse them and when they are going to take a test they would be confused because they were pressured to learn so much in a short period of time and they would not like that because they might fail.
