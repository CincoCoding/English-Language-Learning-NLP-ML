something i would like to accomplish in the future. Would be to be an amazing guitar player. And become one of the best in the world or in the U.S.A . the guitar is one of my favriot instruments. I like to play it makes me feel good

I started playing because of many Hispanic musicians that play guitar. But the Maine reason i wanna play Is for my uncle that use to play. He thought me a little bit and then he was killed. so now i play for him. And i want to become one of the greatest guitar players.

And all the people i look up to play guitar. One of the people i look up to is Jimmy Hendrix. He was amazing he played behind his back. and with his teeth and another person look up to is Johnny cash. he played every were and any were. Did you know that he was the first person to play in a jail. But then not to long ago los tigres del norte played at that same. jail in memory of him los tigres del norte is a famous band in south America. I also look up to Ariel Camacho an amazing singer but he plays a different instrument called requinto. those are some of the people that inspired me to play.

that is what i would like to do in the future. And there might be good money in it. And if i am any good in the future. and i would buy my mother a house. and i would try to walk on the red carpet. i would travel the world with my band. singing. or i might move to Mexico and pursue my dream there same thing but in Mexico.

Those are all of the reasons why i would do it in the future. And why i play now. And did you know that the guitar is the most known instrument around the world. And that more then two thousand people a state in the U.S play it. So thats what i want to do. Not to become a rock star because i dont think there are Hispanic rock stars. because ill be singing in Spanish. thats it.
