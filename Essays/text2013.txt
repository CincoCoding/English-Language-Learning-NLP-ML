Knowledge is more important that Imagination

Knowledge helps your future become successful so how will Imagination help you. It wouldnt really help you just by seeing things with your head. Lets say you played would you rather would you rather have good knowledge or have Imaginations. Is there a way for Imagination to help you?

Can Imagination be helpful to you

Seeing things with your head wont help anything ,but it might help you if you think of anything it will just appear ,although, its not really there. Lets say you want a snow day you just Imagine its snowing outside but you still have school and theres not really snow there. Some people do Imagine things but why?

Imagination can happen to someone

A person starts to imagine things when he or she feels alone ,so he or she starts to think of an imaginary friend and they think that helps them not feel alone. Say that you just played your new game and you start to imagine in your head how fun the game was ,and what things you did in the game. Lets see what we learned.

Conclusion

That was all my reasons why I disagree what Albert Einstein said. Knowledge is more important than Imagination, what can Imagination do to help you, Some people can start to Imagine and think that it will help them. those where my reasons why i disagree.
