For the time students get to high school, Is time for the students to focus more on their future. Students that go to high school are expecting to do more work and be with a different mind set. Going to high school, is the time when students need to think what they want to do in the future, and pick a career that they like. But there are many students, that don't care about their futures, others don't think about their futures in high school. High school is the time when students are able to get focus and think about a career they wanna take. Also to pick a career that you like,and you enjoy doing it. But there are many students that take career just to take them but thats no the career they like so they end it up not achieving nothing.

In high school, is where a lot of students work so they can get money and buy what they want and Also to pay their college career. So identify a career by the time students get to high school help. Because now the students now how much does the career cost, and where he can go studied when he finish high school. Also choosing a career when your young helps, because students have more time to get more information, about the career. And see if there are others career that students would like to take. So thats why committing to a career by the time you get to high school helps you, have more time to view different careers and choose the one u like the best.

Many student that are almost in high school, think about how high school going to be like. So been able to choose a career before high school helps.

And also to be able to search where the he wants to go studied and pick the collage that teach the best for his career.

And finally preparing for a career before high school, gives the students more opportunities.
