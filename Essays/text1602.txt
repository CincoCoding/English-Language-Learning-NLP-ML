Without failure you won't succeed in life. Failure is something you didn't succeed or accomplish yet failure does help you succeed in life. As a matter of fact, this could actually help you accomplish your goals.

I agree with Ralph Waldo statement because, you won't realize your mistakes. For example if you only succeed in life you won't know what to do if you fail or how to fix them. There for you'll achieve and have more success by failing. This helps because you'll actaully know the struggle people would put themself to accomplish their goal. Also knowing you have fail you'll know what is expected in order the success.

I disagree with Ralph Waldo statement because you won't accomplish as much goals. For example you won't know what to do if you ever do fail. i mean is good that your sucessing in life but just wait until the unexpected comes thats whe all the boom lets lose. i fact success isn't as bad is actually good.

In my opinion i would say success isn't as better as failure. They are both a team. While i agree this is why i pick Ralph statement is cause the un expected always comes in lfe.
