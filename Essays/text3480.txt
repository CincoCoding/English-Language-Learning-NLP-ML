Who wants to work alone when you have a chance to work with a group like common! Working in a group is so much beneficial because within a group your able to get your work done quicker and efficient. "who doesn't want that? I know I do". With a group you can also interact and descuse with your peers about your work and get feed back.

Weather or not you agree or disagree with this position. One good thing about working alone is that there are no group distractions. Example you might have that one person in your group that does nothing and just fools around the whole time. Never...

One of the benefits in working in a group is being able to get your work done quicker rather than working by yourself. For example what if you have an SA due in a week and a slideshow to go with it? But you had a choice to to work by yourself or within a group,''I wouldn't think twice about it, I would go with a group".

Also In groups you can discuse and interact with your peers. Groups can also help one another and give eachother feed back depending on what your working one.

Another benefit working within a group is being able to have multiple ideas, thoughts rather than just you having to think and work on everything by yourself. This is the best thing there is to working in a group is that all of you have ideas weather there the same or diffrent,groups can combine eachothers thoughts and ideas to make somthing incredible.

Weather its working in a group project at school or your partisipating in a high end business group its all set to say that working in a group is way benificial than working alone.
