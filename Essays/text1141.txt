No i do not consider that extra two hours a day beacuse it will be a little hard on the students.

10 hours is a lot of hours for a student to be in school and each class would be 2 hours per lucture and that would be stressfull and long. And also there wouln"t be enough time for after school activities if school end at 5p. m and 85% of the students in school join a sport or a band, so if they do practies or the lesson will end late and the students would be tried once they get home and there would be no time for their homework or if you have a test the day after it would be a inconvienes for me to stay up all night to study and get up a couple of hours later and go back to school. And just bcause the businesses extended there work week schdule doesn"t mean student have to beacuse the grown people that have a job its easy for them to work an extra two hours because they dont have all this extra resposiblity a student has.

Plus the people that work get paid by salary or hourly so it really doesn"t matter to them their getting paid regarless if they work 2 hours or 10 hours and students don"t. So i feel like its unfair for ya"ll to add extra school hours to student"s .
