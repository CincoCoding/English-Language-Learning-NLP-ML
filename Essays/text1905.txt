Topic:

Influencing others.

Argument:

Influence is a big word. It has a lot of meanings. It has a lot of ways to describe.

Position:

Mi position is negative for the word influence. It gets othes in wrong ways. It is the word that convince othes to do somthing.

For example:

Somebody offer you some beer, wine, or drugs that are bad influence. If a friend say to you, hey come on lets stole that bicicle it's a bad influence. I now some people that they copy the stile life from others that is not right, so that is the bad influence. Infuence is when somebody buys things that are not health, like Mc donal's, red bulls or chips those are bad influence for you.

Conclusion:

In my conclusion I think that influencing others is not good because it to force many people to do several things wrong. It convince many children to go throught bad ways. However, the word influence can be exellent too. It can describes many things that can be good in your work or in your life.
