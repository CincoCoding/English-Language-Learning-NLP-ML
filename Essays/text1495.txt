It is wonderful how if we are always doining something. If always we doing someting we got more that we think before. We need practice everything. we need practice something that we want.

Do we acoomplish more if we are always doing something. We need think that's what is that we want to acoomplish more that we thing. If I want to be a police I will study hard to be more that a police. I want to buy a iphone 5 but I will work more to buy a iphone 8. I want go to Generic_City with $600 but I will save more to got $1000. We need think before to do something. we need to learnd to save money.

If we doing nothing we never got soemething that we wants. We need to work because if we do not work we never can buy something that we want. if I want pass the SOL of Geometry I need study but if I don't want study i will not pass the SOL. I want a good future but if I doing nothing I will had a future bad I will study and work to had a better future. we need think in the future before doing nothing.

Determine never to be idle. I don't want to be a idle but if i don't be a idle I will never had everythig that I want. I want a car toyota but I will work hard, and think like a idle to work more hard and get more moey to buy a BMW. I need pass all the class to graduate but I want a diploma better that normal one I will doing all homework to pass al the class. we need to be a idle to got everything that we want.

In conclucion, It is wonderful how if we are always doining something. Do we acoomplish more if we are always doing something. Determine never to be idle. But if we want thing that speend a lot money we need to be a idle to got more money, or we want graduate we need study more that other to be better person in the future. for this reason and many other we need to be a idle.
