Im completly agree with this quote, because actually is hard to be youself, a person who dont even know who him is and his proposit in this world and a society were literally nobody cares about who you are, your aspect and your skills that probably gonna be used to enrich other people who doesnt even know you. Sometimes life could be misleading and maybe will be hard to find yourself or your proposit.

even your family could have 2 faces and make your way harder, thats why you need to take care who you trust and select correctly, theres bad people and just because the blood is shared doesnt make them your family. Nobody has born yo be the center of everything, even if everything looks immposible you are still able and free to be the person you wants to be even thought is hard when the world is facing you and making imposible little things,but sometimes you need to accept that somethings aint for you, nothing is just when they was maded to people with more opportunitys sometimes you will feel that you will never get a good chance to do what you actually wants. The future and the time could be creppy but you need to rememember all dreams are possible if when you keep them in mind, is not impossible to be yourself is hard ans sometimes sad when you get lost tryng to find who you are but at the end life will be good because you finally gonna be the person you wants; Because trying to be yourself in this ugly and unfear world is the greatest accomplishment, at the end nothing is more important than you.
