I agree with Emerson's statement a powerful tool, because its always good to know more, then what I already know. That way I can have more experience in other things, and unless I try to do something that I don't know I will never move on.

If I don't try new thing things I will always be stuck with the things that i know, and if I have to do something that i need; and i dont know how to do it i will have to learn it.

Its always good to be learning new things, and I can learn of everything books, television, electronic devices, many other things.

people complement me when I show how to do something or at least say thank you, and that makes you feel really good about your self.

Learning its always good to my mind because it keeps my mind working, and I feel good learning new things interesting things like learning about animals that i didnt know about or learning about a country.

Unless I try to do something beyond what I have already mastered, I will never grow.

I always like to be learning it makes me want to learn more about a specific topic or just learn about new things, because if I dont then I will never move on, and I will always know the same things.

But I can start learning new things, and know a lot of things, how to do stuff, or just to something, because I never know when I am going to need that knowledge.
