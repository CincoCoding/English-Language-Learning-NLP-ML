I remember one time when I applied for one school that was private. I talked with the principal of that school, and he told me that. I needed a specific career for to be in his school.

Students need a specific career by the time they enter to high school.

I'm agree with this article because you already know what do you wnat to do and study to be a proffesional in a future just choose a career that you like it, and then do it.

choose a career that you feel that you like it, and practice all the time for example; I like the mechanic career. I like the cars, and I feel that mechanic would be a good career, because you fix the cars, and I think I can get good money for it.

when you feel that something you like it, you want to do all the time, if you have a career that you like it, practice you career for example; I love play soccer and, play soccer is one of my favorite things I like to do in the summer I practice a lot soccer , one of my dream is to be a proffesional soccer player one day because I love soccer choose one career of proffesional always keep in your mind, and try to do the best to get your career. Each student have a career that they like, but sometimes they don't get the career that they want for reason of the life, but do you best to get finished you career one day for example; my sister she wanted to be a nurse, and she always practice the things that one nurse do, and she always studied a lot for be a nurse, and now she have six year working of nurse. She get career that she wanted, and she told me that when she was little she wanted to be a nurse, and now she is a nurse.

Found your self first and look what you want to be in a future, is a lot things in this world, and you look for something that you feel happy doing it found a career that you like it, and try to get it.
