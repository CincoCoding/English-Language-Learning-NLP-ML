Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. Responsible and hard-worker people are the top choosen. Employers need to know that they can rely on this person in rough time. A trustworthy person who can help the team be better and cooperate positively.

No employer would hire someone who can't be at work in time, someone who always finds excuses to stay at home, someone who can't accept to be wrong.

I remember the way I was raised. My mother do not know how to read just because her parents were poor. In my country, Haiti, school is very expensive and not accessible for everyone. But, I had this opportunity because my mother made the impossible become possible. As she always said, '' Je me leve a l'aube du jour et m'endorme apres le couche du soleil pour que tu sois fiere de toi meme, et sois capable d'aider les gens comme moi. " I graduated high school with advanced diploma. My mother died. She did not have the chance to see the fruit of her hard-work.

I want to make her pride from where she is. Because she was a hard-worker. She is my model. I have known how it felt to be miserable, dependent, be rejected, to count on someone, to fail again and again.

Even though I did not go to college, I am proud of myself. I can read, write, and speak not only one language but, 3 different ones.

I have learned to offer the better side of me in anything I am doing. I will not say I am the "Albert Einstein'' of this generation but, I am intelligent , fast learner, humble and cooperative. I might not be the most experienced person for this work, but I am a good candiade.
