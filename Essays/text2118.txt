Many student's take districts offer programs because , They think that is more easy . School's maybe is easy ,if student's going to school only three years . Also, some parents maybe are agree with that . if student's go three years to school . the students parents spend a little money in their . Also, student's can work early and get their own money. Especially , if school during three years. but, definitely , many student's take the longer way in high school . that's the mean. the four years.

Also student's choose this districts offer programs to graduated quickly from high school and work . for example , my friend take districts offer programs and he is graduated rigth now. but, he spend all his time only studing and him have his diploma and him is working. but, i'm taking the four years in school ,not only ... but also, obviously , i'm learning more . because , i spend more time in school. Clearly students wants to graduated from high school , that's why they take this programs . and some student's choose this programs because , they want go to the collage . and want to meet their dream.

I understand that many student's wants to graduated quickly and get their diplomas . but take the four years in high school is better than districts offer program . because , student's who take this programs are grieve and

, obviously , their are very busy and extressed . because they don't have time . They only pass all days , evening and summer studing , but student's who take the four years are fresh of the mind and they have time for studing and work at the same time. and can spend time for their friend and family, thats why four years in high school is bettter than three years. Definitely , some students prefert districts offer programs. but they kill their own self . because they pass studing ans studing. their many students like studing alot , but its importantly, that they safe their health .
