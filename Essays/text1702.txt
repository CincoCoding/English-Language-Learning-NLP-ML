do you think that these classes should be electives or a core class?.I say that it should be an elecitve because some peole are taking it as electives and so they cahn graduate on time thats why i say they should make theses classes go for elecitives and kids will like more drama and art and or music classes. more than core classes cause core classses are required for gradutaion and the elecitves are for fun and i think that the school should give these classes as an elecitve because it will be fun to learn new things and explore what you would be good at.

some people may believe that you should take a music class,or art class,or drama class however; i believe That those classes should be electives cause their less important then the core classes. but at the same time it would be fun to have one of those classes. and so you expiernce something new. and you get to meet new and differnt people and thats why it should be an elective.
