Do you think students taking an elective class is a good idea? Will I think it's a great for kids to art as an elective class because some kids love to draw, others can learn how to draw and even use it in real life situation. So this are the reasons why I think taking art as an elective is a good idea.

Some students will love taking art as an elective because they love to draw. Students will love taking art during school. For example, my friend never had time to work on her art projects after school; therefore, she had a talk with her counselor so she can get put in a art class. Once she got into the art class she had more time to work on her art projects in school. She was also doing something she good at while getting a grade for it.

Students can learn how to draw if they had a art class. Some students want to learn how to draw, but never had a chance to. Therefore, if the school give students a art class they can really learn a lot. Art is not only about drawing; however, some students don't know that. One day, my mom took a art class because she want to learn how to draw. But the art class didn't just teacher her how to draw. She got to learn about the history of art wish is pretty amazing.

Some people think taking art as an elective is not a good idea because students not going to need art once they are done with school. I disagree because some students might wan to be come a artist later on in life. I know a lot of artist who making a lot of money just by drawing. Students who might want to take art can be come famous one day. So taking art class as an elective is a great idea for students.

These are the reason why I think students should have art as an elective class some students love to drawn, some students want to learn, others can even using in life. Art is a great thing so why not enjoy it.
