I am not agree with those educators that say, the summer break is too long and the students can't retain imformation as easily when they return in the fall. The summer break is made to a students's benefit, it help the students as a relajation during the summer. The students have to spend time with their family a lot as possible they can. Some of them need to make money, and they take the summer break to make it. That is why I am not agree the educators that does't wants the summer break long.

One reason,the students are in the school almost a whole year, and all that time they are stressed by all the work they have to do in the school. Caming the summer break the students wait it with antusiasm, and work hard to finish the school's work and enjoy summer break, it help them as a relajation after a school's stress, they have to forget the school by a mommet, and relax their brains. Second reason, during the school's time the students does't have a lot of time to spend with their family, and the summer break is a good time of the year to spend it with their dear, persons, friends, classmate, girlfriend, and family. After it, the students are more prepared to star the school's year concentred at what they have to focus in the school with a clean brain ,and do all the school's work. Third reason, some students have some obligations in their homes, for example some of those are: pay cellphone, pay room, buy food, and pay car, so some student take advantages of the summer break to make some money to helps them to pay all their obligations in their homes, and don't take the school's time to spend it in other obligations, and take their time just to teh schools. Finally, the student does't need the summer break shorter, they have a lot of things to do during the summer break, and it would't be justly to them, I am againt to the educators that feel the summer break is too long.
