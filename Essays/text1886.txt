Have you ever group up with older or younger students before? And you think of eachother's differently and won't work it out, well there a program that helps older and younger to solve that problem.

Older students can teaches the younger students to learn the next year problems or tests that is coming up. The younger students would confuses how do the problems infront of them and would need helps. The older students help the younger students with their studies. Older students can help them read the sentences on the problems they have or help with the steps of the problem. The younger students can help the older students what they learned and teach them how the problems works again. A lot of older students forgot what they learned in the past and it's stressful. In sixth grade, my teacher let's all sixth grades read with 2nd graders and it's how younger and older bonds little bit.

The younger and older students can bond eachother in the program. They can learn from eachother what they do in their own grades to lighten up the day without awkwardness. It's a teamwork program that helps younger and older students to assist for eachother. It's like a group project and they have to work with eachother to finish the project and helps eachother step by step. One time i was little a older student alway read to me and slowly we bonded, It's was nice at the end of the day. Bonding is a key to success of learning from eachother and we are the same person with different thoughts and mind.
