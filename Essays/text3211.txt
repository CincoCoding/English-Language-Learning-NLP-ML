Dear principal ,As a student i think we should balance The school menu of healththeir school lunches is a good idea and also a bad idea, the resaon why is when most students don't take care of their own body by eating junk food but most student like their favorite food for example, most students in my class when they eat their favorite food for example pizza, in lunch it will affect their stomach but not only their stomach but they have nothing health besides milk to eat.

My second reason is when you eat health on school days your body will feel better and relax and also when you eat healthier foods your body can help you in the future as you grow older health foods in school would be a great way for students not to be sick and they need protein to grow.

My thrid reason is if you take away our favorite food most students wont eat the healtheir food, remember when their was no Fried Chicken friday at lunch and thats like everyones favorite food the school was so upset they didnt eat lunch for the day over chicken. So in conclusion I think that we should balance them out like their should days were we eat health foods and days we can eat favortite foods.

When the food is Balance students will be able be more happy if they just have both their favorrite foods and something Health to eat, so in my opinon i really hope you make students have both their favorrite foods and healtheir foods so that all students would be happy and so as their body.
