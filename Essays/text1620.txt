I think it took a positive affect on humans lives. I think it would be impossible with out technology. My reasons are that we use technology a lot,we use it for to shop online for our phones. My two other reasons are we use them for work. We use technology for school and to learn things from back then from now.

We use technology for online and for our phones. So if we needed to contact someone it would be threw our phones. If we needed something to wear we go online buy something. If we needed go some where the in our phones theres GPS will guide us. We use our phones for lots of thing like looking at the news, or to see what time is it. Our phones has a lot of knowledge so if we need something new we use our technology

We use technology for work like if we needed finish something we know how to do it. If we needed look something up for work we do it threw our technology. If your boss calls you in for something hes using technology. So if we did not have technology we could not do anything that what we are doing today.

We use technology for our school like now Im taking test on my computer. We use technology for learning things like in history we are learning stuff from the past. We use technology for tests and to print some papers out. We use projectors for class if we need to see something. We use technology for our safety like cameras.

So without technology we could not do anything like call or text or shop online or learn. Are lives have changed a lot when technology was invented. Technology is all around everywhere you go theres going to be technology.
