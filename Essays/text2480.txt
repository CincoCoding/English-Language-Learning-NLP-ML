For various reason's i think that student's should have at least a B average to be able to participate in sports or other activities. the first reason is because a lot of student's maybe think that a C average it good. But , for many other student's a B is a better average then, a C.

Also, i think that it would be a better reason for the student's because a lot of student's want to participate in sports or other activities. So, then they could focus more in school and, get good average's.

The second reason is that parent's would also be happy for there children to have good grade's and, that they could participate in school activities. and, also they will be proud of there self's. So
