I agree with Thomas Jefferson we must never be determined to be idle. Becuase life is too short you got to follow your dreams don't be idle. Everday you do more you learn more, you acomplish more as long as you believe, and have the heart for it .I don't like braging about my self but I am allways doing something. Right now i am 18 and belive it or not i own two busniss. I make good money but it everday is a struggle to keep the busniss runnig good and going to school but i never once thought about stoping here i wana do more i wana be sombody .

Frist, reason why i agree with Thomas jefferson is becuase if your idle you will never make it out i promise here is a example Donald Trump he is one of the richest people in America and he has his own air plane decraded with 24k gold so you know he has accomplished a lot of things he can be retired living in a island right now but right now instead he is the president of united states you know why becuase he is not a idle person he wants to do more like what Ragin(rip to thats mans) said "dont ask what your country could do for you ask what you can do for your country" and that is what Donald is doing right now he is doing more and acomplishing more .

also, its okay to be idle some times we humans everydody needs a little break just as long as you believe. And make goals for your self you will be alright. The most important thing is that you do it the right way their are no short cuts in life and that is why i agree with Thomas Jefferson "determine never to be idle."
