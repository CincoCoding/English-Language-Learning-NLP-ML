With great imagination comes with great knowledge, with both, you'll be able to conduct something amazing! You can have great knowledge and little imagination, but you can have imagination without knowledge.

I personally disagree on Albert Einstein stated, yes imagination is very important and useful, but it's not more important than knowledge. I say that because, people everyday, all the time, imagine great things all the time but without any knowladge, how will they make that thought turn into reality without having any knowledge what so ever??

Knowledge is way more important that imagination because many inventors, scientist, constrution workers, normal people, use it in thier every-day lives! Imagination us just one step with in into reaching to a goal or something, if you have plenty of knowledge of your dream, you'll be able to grab that goal!

But knowledge isn't just about reaching a goal or building something, it's about having idea or knowing what your doing and what's going around you.

In conclution, knowledge is way more usefull than a thought bouncing in your head, Knowledge is way more better because it helps us build many great things like, electronics, machines, stores, ect. Sorry Einstein, I just don't agree with you.
