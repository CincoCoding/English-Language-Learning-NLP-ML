First, this activity has been done by everyone in the world. Which is dancing, everydody at least dances once in their lives. As we speak some people take this activity to the next level. Performing at competitions or shows people pay to watch. This activity is not only enjoyable but educational for those who seek interest in dancing. There are so many things you can learn froming dancing like tap, ballet, hip pop, jazz, and ballroom dancing and more.

Second, you express your emotion, all that anger and sadness you hide, you put that into your dance its what makes it special. Do what your body tells you to do, let out whatever it is your feeling, let your emotion tell a story. Its like writing a story in a book but the only thing different is that you are moving.

Third, dancing takes alot of energy, so that means you have to have a good meal before you can dance. Streach your body so you won't pull a muscle, which can be very painful and sometimes can lead to surgery. After streaching, warm up yourself so you can build your stigma, it will help you when you are feeling weak and tired. Always drink water because you are always sweating and you need to hydrate your body.

Fourth, when you are dancing there is never a right to wrong. Its like a test with no answer key, it just keeps going without stoping. Don't doubt yourself because nobody is going to be perfect, if you want to dance like you run the world then trust yourself.

Finally if you enjoy dancing and you have passion, You are going to be unstopable. All you just have to remember is to just have fun and be you. Teach others and show them that if they are feeling alone, they are never alone because you will be right there next to them guideing them every step of the way.

In conclusion this activity is super enjoyable and fun because you will meet new people and you will have new friends and people who share the same intrest as you. Just remeber as long as you, put your mind and heart into whatever you want to do, anything is possible thats why this activity taught me so much about loving myself.
