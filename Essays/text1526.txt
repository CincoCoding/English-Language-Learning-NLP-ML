I think it is a good idea that people should ask for others peoples advice because they can learn extra info from them. Because if you tell multiple people for an advice they can get more opinions from people. They can also get help someone make a better choice. You might learn different opnions from alot of different people and they can give you alot of advice on what not to do and what you should do. Its smart because if people ask for other peoples opinions they will get more ideas and facts and what they should do next.

The second reasons why I think people should ask multiple questions to a variet of different people is because so they can get alot of responses and more answers to their questions. The more people ask for advice they will get multiple opinions. If I dont ask questions iill never get any responses or advices. So thast why I think people should ask for others peoples advice all the time.
