Teacher want to make a homework clube for student at schools. I think they want to start this club so students do there homework for offten and teacher are going to helps you if your need help. This is going help kids be responsible and learn more. Doing a homework club after school is going to help kids alot.

I think its a good idea but also a bad idea. The reson why i think its good is because it can help kids if they need help. The reson i think is a bad idea is beacause kids are going to have to stay after school but its bad cause they might have somthing planed. Its good and bad cause kids need to learn how to be responsble.

Tenns/kids might think its a waist of time. They might get bored and just might not to there homework. They wont like staying after scchol kids and teens might just think its a waist of time. They just mont like it at all.

4. i support this because its going to help students out by doing there homework. Students are going to do there homework now. Even tho they might thinks its dumb its not its relly going to help them. Hopefully student start doing there homework now.
