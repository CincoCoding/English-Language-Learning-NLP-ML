The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote you your character will be what you yourself choose. In my opinion we choose our own character, and how we respect other people teachers, and students. My mom teach me how to behavior but she do not choose my own character, nonetheless some peoples make us strong but they don't choose own character, but on the other hand sometimes we need to change our character for example, my English teacher have a beautiful character but apart from that, sometime she need to changes her character because the students do not put attention in the classroom, and she have to be rude that way they stop talking and distract the other students, but however she never change her beautiful character.

The first step that I say that nobody choose our own character is because when we are sad nobody can change our attitude or own character somebody can try to help us but they don't gonna change our attitude because when we are sad sometimes we are angry, and our character is so bad that we don't want to do anything we just want to be alone or we just need to take a brake because maybe we are stress. My mom teach my how to behavior and that I have to respect the older peoples but she don't choose how my character it gonna be

In other words some peoples make us strong like my mom she teach me how to be strong too, and some peoples teach you that how to be strong but they don't choose how we gonna be how we gonna act, they can't teach us or change us our character we are the only person who decided If we need to change our character, however sometimes we need to change our character and that is gonna help us in the school in the house and in the life, and a person who is very respectful nice and have a good character is very important because what happened if you are angry have a bad character in the work nobody is gonna like to work with you the same happened in the school, if we have a bad character nobody is want to work with us that why sometimes is very important to change our character

The last reason but not the less important is without a doubt sometimes is important to changes our character like for example, my English teacher have some students that they don't care about the class, and she need to change her character in the class so that way the students stop talking and distracting the class, and when she change is character they stop to talk because she put angry and rude, but however she never change her character she always are happy she only change the character when the students are talking or playing in the class but they don't change the teacher character she change her own character

Nobody can change our character we decides if we change or not, sometimes it is important to make some changes to be a better person, and to help our self or to help other people, a person with a good attitude and with a good character always is gonna be good work with them we need to know when we need to change, and why we need to change and that is gonna help us for the life and for everything and always it is important to smile.
