To conserve energy and resourses.

In my opinion:Resourses something such as land, minerals or natural energy that exists,businesses have a great idea to adothing and making eigty hours a week for the four days is a big benefit,special when the businesses or corporation big they will be have more a prifi in the future, not money but in other patways they will have help for Example,food same of the people they will think is disavantages for the businesses, because some of then will understanding and some of them not.

In this case in my school I think, should be follow the model to,but a little difefently,because school is not businesses, would extending, making two hours but not everyone,want to, but if people understanding it a good extending because if we conserved the energy and resources we can proveid such as land mineralsor natural energy, Example: The enviroment will have more conserve energy.

The more important is how to know adopthed the hours to conserved energy, we will do for provide goos and have extraordinary successful.
