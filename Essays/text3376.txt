I think older kids should not be pair with younger kids because they can be a bad example,not being good around young ones, and not respectful to younger Kids

I think the should not be pair with younger kids. If a older kids does something bad the younger ones might do it to. It can go super wrong like if a older kid does a trick in a skateboard. The older knows how to do it. But the younger does not know how to do it he can break . Something arm or leg. One my brother was with his friend doing trick on his skateboard and i tried to do it but i fell and Brock my arm.\

I think older kid should not be around younger kids. Because they can be on drugs or be smoking who knows. That bad for younger kids if a kid see you smoking all the the smoke can go to his lungs and maybe give him cancer or die. My fiend Generic_Name brother was smoking around us we told that smoking can kill us and him bu he didn't Leasing.

I think older kid should be respectful to younger kid and everybody. So they don't to be like them if you're respectful to other younger kids can be respectful to others. But if you're not respectful other are not going to be respectful. One my friend brother was not being respectful to us so we were not being respectful to him.

This is why i think older kid should not be around younger kids. There not respectul,bad example and there not good around young kids. If the were repectful,responsible it would be ok around younger kids.
