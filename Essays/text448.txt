Churchill statement is right because failing in life is part of succeeding. Those obsticals you go through in life are part of who you become and how you handle those obsticals. It gives some type of motivation to keep moving forward and get to whatever goal it is. My example is when i got pregnant my junior year and when I found out i just wanted to drop out because I was still a kid myself and I kept thinking how people would look at me or what would they say, but I already had an idea. My parents didnt even support me so what motivation did I have? I had myself and my son. I took that as my motivation, yes it was difficult especially after I delivered and going back to school because I was very behind. Of course a lot of friends stopped talking to me but that just proves who's there for you and who's not. I was starting a new chapter in my life and I'm not saying having my son was a mistake but it was just at the wrong time; cant change the past though, you just have to keep moving forward.

Here I am now my senior year, eight more months until I graduate and I'm proud of myself because I am a mother now and I'm still going to school, I didnt let that stop me from getting my education and I'm planning to go to college too because all I want is the best for my son and myself; its not me I have to think about now, I have another responsibility to look after for. There are many examples of failing in life and later on succeeding but this is one I went through, I had to grow up fast but it made me the person I am today. Just because of one mistake you make in life doesnt mean your life is over, its probably just the beginning, we are human! We all make mistakes but you just have to keep moving forward because life goes on with or without you.
