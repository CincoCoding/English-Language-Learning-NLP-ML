Would you like to start your life early?

Graduating is a privilege in general for everyone. Most find it very very important if you want to succeed in life and make great money. on the other hand some many not and find it important and waste of time. I think everyone who doesnt find it important should really think twice. Yes I understand that some classes are better than others, but its all required for one to graduate.

In my opinion i support both sides of the story. Some people want to start their life early some do not. Even if you wanted to graduate early its a challenge. obvious you would have to take extra classes, and to make those up you have a choice to take it during the summer, online, or night school which ever is best. its nice to graduate early because if one goes to college they see that and they think best of you.

On the other hand i do not think it's a good a idea to graduate early. Only if you have the right skills and capability for it. Gradating early is not for everyone some struggle in the normal four standard years of high school. It is not a requirement at all. High school is not a race its preparing you for your future its good to take all the time you need maybe if need to stay in extra year or two.

In conclusion like I said "I support both sides" it is not necessary to graduate nor is it a requirement. Graduating early is only for those who already want to go to college or go into the work force. Graduating in the normal four years is grate if you dont know what your going to be yet after high school. There is never no rush. Always take your time its your future.
