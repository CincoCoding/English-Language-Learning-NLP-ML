DEAR PRINCIPAL,

I think that students can help if they want to. but it will be very helpful to the community service. people and parents can take position helping the community. it will be more helpful if all the school cam and help the community. teacher can help to if they want. service to the community will help your town in lots of ways. like help pick up litter, help people in need, save in dangered animals. it can all so help cleaning the planet as well the students can start helping the would clean up the planet. they can stop the green house effect. then we fine better way to use power to support the world.

love, you friendly student.
