I belive the elimination of human contact due to technology is a positive thing. Now days everything you need is only a click of a button away. this makes life easier and better. techonolgy is evolving such as humans are evolving too. on the other hand, technology can alsow be used as a bad thing. it could be used as a source of bullying. Technology has given us the privilage to be able to play a game with many people even though we are all far away. When tchnology was not as developed, you had to write a letter, mail it , and wait weeks for a response. Now days thanks to technology you can talk to someone on the other side of the world and not have that time gap to wait for there response. Technology has also made the world a safer place. we now have all types of camers for different things. before technology it was almost impossible to stop someone from breaking into your home or catching someone stealing. however, today we have camers protecting our homes, stores have cameras to catch shoplifters. Technology plays a big rol in education. Students have better education because of technology. you dont have to go to a library to buy a book to learn something. Today you can look everything up on the internet.

Technology might be a good thing and make life easier but it can alsow be used as a bad thing. Many people use technology for hacking. Hackers can steal credit card information, your personl information, and other personal things. Other people use technology for stalking, or tracking someone.. there are many dar webs on the internet, also known as the 'BLACK MARKET'. On these websites human parts are sold for a big amounnt of money. Technology can also be used for human traficking. and for selling drugs. The end of the day, i belive technology can be a very helpful tool for humans but it all depends on how one uses it. in conclusion, I belive the limination of human contact due to the use of technology has a positive effect on people's lives.
