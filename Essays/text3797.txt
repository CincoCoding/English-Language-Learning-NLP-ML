I agree with Winston Churchill that success consits and failing many times.

One reason is that if you fail, that is going to make stronger for the next time. It's like a game; you are going to do whaterver it takes to gain the game. If you do not do it in the first round, it's going to be the second and you'll do even better. A lots of people think that if they don't do it in the first time, that's going to be it. They don't realize that if they just keep going they're going to get there, and be success. Wouldn't it be great if we didn't have to fail? but that's how it's some times. We have to accept it and keep trying. Life is fool of problems, but we just have hang in there and keep trying and get where we want.

Another reason is that never loss of enthusiasm, that's the most important reason of all of this. if we don't have that exclusive word is like life does not make sense at all. For example, I used to have this friend that his mom wanted him to be a doctor, but he didn't want to be a doctor. He wanted to be a teacher. Farthermore, he study to be a doctor. He wasn't that good but that was what his mom wanted. The second year, which was even harder he just stop. He talked to his mom saying that was not for him. He did not have any enthusiasm on that career, so he fanilly started classes to become a teacher. now, that was for him. He did so much better, good grades and excellents jobs. In short, he never lost the enthusiasm to be a what he wanted.

Some people migth say that you don't have to fail, that you have to be success all the time. They migth say that is not ok to fail. However, that's not true, you can fail it's going to make you strong. you are going to have experience and you're going to do things so much better. If you can't do it in the first then, go for the next, and next until you can finally make it.

In summary, success consist and failing many times.
